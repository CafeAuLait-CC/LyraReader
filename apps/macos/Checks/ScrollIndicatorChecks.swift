/// The overlay scroll indicator, checked where it can be checked without a hand on the mouse.
///
/// Two halves:
///
/// * the pointer geometry is a pure type (`ScrollIndicatorGeometry`), so a whole drag can be
///   driven here — top of the track to the bottom and back, a drag that leaves the track, grab
///   offsets, and the cases where a thumb could otherwise invert or a fitting document could
///   still claim an indicator;
/// * the state that decides whether the indicator may be grabbed at all is asserted against a
///   real `AppState`. This is the half that would have caught the original defect: the old
///   indicator was hit-testable only while `isScrolling` was true, so it was ungrabbable exactly
///   when a reader reached for it.
///
/// What is *not* asserted here: that AppKit routes a real mouse press to the lane, that hovering
/// the lane fires, that the capsule's visible position matches the geometry, or that the preview
/// panel / note overlay stay in front. Those need a hand on the mouse.
