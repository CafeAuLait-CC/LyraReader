/// split, identity, undo and save rules for a drag that cuts only part of a stroke.

/// real engine, on scratch copies of the committed fixtures. The canvas is wired exactly as
/// `ReaderWindow` wires it, so a press/drag here takes the same route a hand does: `mouseDown` →
/// `beginEraserGesture`, `mouseDragged` → `extendEraserGesture`, `mouseUp` → `endEraserGesture`.
