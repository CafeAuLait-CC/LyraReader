/// ADR 0007 split the two tile caches in this repository: the hot-path cache stays in the
/// shell, but it adopts the **byte budget** policy that `crates/lyra-reader-render/src/cache.rs`
/// already encoded. This type is that policy, ported to Swift; the Rust module stays as its
/// specification and test bed. The rules, in the order they matter:
///
/// 1. **Bytes, not tiles.** The budget is spent from `PageImage.bgra.count` — the actual
///    bitmap the cache retains (tile pixel size × 4), never an estimate. A tile count cannot
///    bound memory: at deep zoom the reader wants many more tiles, and the pre-ADR count cap
///    of 96 was exceeded whenever those wanted tiles filled it (measured: 110 tiles).
/// 2. **Pinned tiles are never evicted.** The caller passes what must survive: the tiles
///    visible in the current viewport plus the rasters in flight. If the pinned set alone
///    exceeds the budget, the cache exceeds the budget — dropping a visible tile to hit a
///    number would trade correctness for memory. (Same rule as `all_pinned_never_evicts`.)
/// 3. **The newest insert is protected** during the eviction pass that follows it, so a tile
///    that was just rasterized is not thrown away before it can be drawn. (Rust:
///    `newest_insert_is_protected_but_older_ones_are_not`.)
/// 4. **LOD-aware LRU.** Among evictable tiles, one from a LOD *other* than the current one
///    goes first: after a zoom, the previous level's tiles are the ones nothing will draw
///    again. Within a LOD class the least recently used tile goes first.
