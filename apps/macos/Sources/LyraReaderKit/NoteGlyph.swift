/// and are the reason this file exists rather than a call to `NSImage` at the draw site:
///
/// * **Straight alpha.** CoreGraphics hands back premultiplied bytes, and the quad pipeline blends
///   straight alpha (`src·a + dst·(1 − a)`), so a premultiplied bitmap is composited with its alpha
///   applied twice — which shows up as dark fringes along every antialiased edge. The buffer is
///   divided back out by its own alpha before it is uploaded.
/// * **A resolution, not a size.** The bitmap is rasterized at `zoom × deviceScale` pixels per
///   point, rounded up to a power of two, because the canvas scales it by the same zoom the page
///   under it is rasterized at. Without that, a note icon is crisp at 100% and mush at 400%.
///
/// Nothing here reads the file's font: a free-text annotation names a face this process does not
/// have (`/DFWaWaSC-W5`, a Chinese face, in 22 of the 23 free-text annotations in the local review
/// corpus), so the text is drawn in the system font at the size `/DA` states.
