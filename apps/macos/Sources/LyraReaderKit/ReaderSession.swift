/// One LyraReader window's own document session: its tabs, its current document, its reading position,
/// its zoom and its own engine.
///
/// **Why this type exists.** Before it, the application made exactly one `AppState` — in
/// `LyraReaderAppDelegate.init` (`DocumentOpening.swift`) — and handed that same object to
/// *every* window the scene makes (`LyraReaderApp.swift`: `ReaderWindow(state: appDelegate.state,
/// opener: appDelegate.opener)`). Two windows were therefore two views of one session: one `tabs`
/// array, one `document`, one `scrollYPt`, one `zoomPercent`, and one `PDFEngine` holding one
/// open `LyraReaderDocument` (`Engine.swift`, `RustEngine.document`). The reader's report — a PDF
/// dropped on the Dock icon opens a second window, and both windows then show the same tabs and
/// scroll together — is that ownership graph, not a rendering, sync or scroll bug. A test written
/// against the old graph fails on its first assertion: the scene's two windows are handed the
/// *identical* object (`delegate.state === delegate.state`).
///
/// The fix is ownership, not synchronisation. Everything a reader can change about "what this
/// window is showing" lives in this session and is reachable from no other window:
///
/// * `state` — `AppState`, which owns `document`, `tabs`, `activeTabIndex`, `scrollYPt`,
///   `zoomPercent`, the selection, search results, annotations, the tile cache, **and the
///   engine**;
/// * `opener` — the coordinator for documents that arrive from outside the window (the Dock,
///   Finder, `open -a`) and for files dropped on *this* window's canvas;
/// * `previewPanels` — the floating reference panel, which used to be a process-wide singleton
///   (`ReferencePreviewPanelController.shared`) that every window re-synced: with per-window state
///   the second window's update would close the first window's panel.
///
/// What stays process-wide is what *is* process-wide, and none of it is per-window state: the
/// PDFium library (a `OnceLock`, `crates/lyra-reader-pdfium/src/backend.rs`), the wgpu device
/// (`static GPU`, `crates/lyra-reader-ffi/src/lib.rs`), AppKit, and the window server. A second
/// engine therefore does **not** buy a second copy of that floor; what it costs is per-document
/// state, which a second independent window needs anyway (see the pull request's measurement).
