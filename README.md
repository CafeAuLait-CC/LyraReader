# LyraReader

A **native macOS PDF reader** for papers and technical documents: Rust engine, GPU-composited rendering,
SwiftUI/AppKit interface. Read, annotate and edit PDFs without a web view, and reach the tools a reader of
papers actually needs — clickable citations and figures, a searchable outline, metadata and BibTeX, and an
optional AI assistant.

The repository, the Rust crates (`lyra-reader-*`), the Swift modules (`LyraReaderKit`, `LyraReaderFFI`) and the
developer environment variables (`LYRA_READER_*`) share the `lyra` prefix; the application, its bundle
(`LyraReader.app`), its window titles and its icon all say **LyraReader**.

Design notes, measurement records and the task list are kept outside this repository on purpose (see the note
under *Directory layout*). What ships here is the code, the scripts, the fixtures and this overview.

## Status

Working today: reading with sharp GPU page rendering and deep-zoom tiles, selection and search, tabs and
independent windows, an outline with numbering, annotated thumbnails and reply threads, highlight /
underline / strikethrough / ink / shapes / sticky notes / text boxes / stamps and image signatures, all of
them written back into the PDF, staged page editing with undo, merge and split, forms, redaction that removes
content, printing, bookmarks, citation / figure / table previews, paper metadata with BibTeX, annotation
export, an index cache, and the AI assistant.

Deliberately not done: cross-platform shells (Linux, Windows), localisation, automatic updates, and a handful
of editing niceties documented in the task list. In-place body-text editing and full content editing exist as
separate features with their own documented limits.

## Capabilities

- **Read**: GPU-composited pages at the display's true resolution, tile pyramid for deep zoom, facing pages,
  page gap, calibrated zoom (Actual Size / Fit Width / Fit Page), independent windows.
- **Navigate**: outline with section numbers and levels, thumbnails that show the file's own annotations,
  document-wide search, per-window Back/Forward across preview jumps.
- **Annotate**: text markup, ink, shapes, sticky notes, text boxes, stamps and image signatures — with undo,
  a sidecar that survives crashes, and a verified write-back into the PDF.
- **Edit pages**: rotate, delete, reorder, insert, extract, merge and split, all staged with undo and verified
  on write; forms; document properties (Info and XMP); redaction that removes the covered content; printing.
- **Papers**: clickable citations (author–year, bracketed, superscript and bare parenthetical numerals),
  figure/table/algorithm previews with transparent crops, metadata recognition with BibTeX export.
- **Assist**: an optional assistant in its own right-hand panel — document chat with retrieval across the
  whole file, citation chips that jump to the verified source and flash it briefly, plus summarise / selection
  Q&A / translation — over an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or a ChatGPT plan, with the request previewed before
  anything leaves the machine and the key held in the Keychain.

## Tech stack (decided)

| Dimension | Choice | Rationale / ADR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rendering & compositing | **wgpu 30** (macOS → Metal; future Windows → DX12, Linux → Vulkan) | One GPU layer reused across all three platforms · [ADR-0003](docs/adr/0003-gpu-wgpu-shared-device.md) |
| PDF engine | **Backend trait abstraction + PDFium as the first implementation** (BSD-3), with a slot reserved for a pure-Rust backend | The only engine that supports rendering, per-glyph text boxes, links, forms and incremental save at once · [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-pdf-engine-backend.md) |
| UI | **SwiftUI + AppKit** (native macOS), with UI logic pushed down into the platform-independent `lyra-reader-session` | Native look and feel, input methods and accessibility; a future shell swap won't require rewriting the engine · [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-native-ui-stack.md) |
| Bridging | **UniFFI** (control plane) + hand-written C ABI (GPU surface/device handoff) | Generates Swift bindings automatically, supports async and callback streams · [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-rust-swift-ffi.md) |
| License | This project is **MIT**; all dependencies use permissive licenses | [ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-licensing.md) |
| Build | Cargo workspace + SwiftPM (**Command Line Tools only**, CLT 26.3 on this machine) | Develop without a full Xcode install · [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-build-without-xcode.md) |

> **Note**: `docs/` and `.gitignore` are intentionally **local-only** — they are not committed (both are listed in
> `.gitignore` itself). A fresh clone therefore contains code, scripts and this README, but no design documents and no
> default ignore rules, so build output (`target/`, `build/`, `apps/macos/.build/`, `vendor/`) shows up as untracked
> until you recreate a `.gitignore`.

## Quick start

```bash
./scripts/fetch-pdfium.sh          # PDFium dynamic library (needed for rendering; not committed)
./scripts/build-rust.sh            # Rust static library + generated UniFFI Swift bindings
cd apps/macos && swift build       # add --disable-sandbox in a sandboxed shell
swift run LyraReader               # LYRA_READER_OPEN=/path/to.pdf opens a document at launch
./scripts/make-app-bundle.sh       # output: build/LyraReader.app
./scripts/check.sh                 # full gate: Rust tests, Swift build, native regression suite
```

The developer commands that are not needed to build and run — headless test hooks, fixture generation,
reference-raster comparisons, the CLI inspection commands and the measurement recipes — are documented in the
design notes rather than here.

## Documentation index

The design documents live in `docs/` in the working copy and are **not committed** (see the note under
*Directory layout*), so the links below resolve locally. Two design documents do ship with the code:
[PDF-CONTENT-EDITING.md](PDF-CONTENT-EDITING.md) (the content editor's model, limits and verification) and
[RENAMING.md](RENAMING.md) (the rename's scope and upgrade compatibility).

| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Skeleton, FFI path, GPU interop | Complete |
| M1 | Minimum readable loop | Core implemented; performance and memory budgets still measured by hand |
| M2 | Reading experience | Complete: tabs, independent windows, outline, search, bookmarks, facing pages |
| M3 | Annotation and editing | Complete for annotations, page operations, forms, redaction and printing; in-place body editing is its own feature with documented limits |

| M7 | Polish: performance, accessibility, i18n, updates | Not started |

Per-milestone detail, measurements and the remaining work live in the design notes, not here.
