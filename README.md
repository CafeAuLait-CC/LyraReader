# LyraReader

A **native macOS PDF reader** for papers and technical documents: Rust engine + GPU-composited rendering + native SwiftUI/AppKit interface.
The goal is PDF Expert-level simplicity and fluidity, with two advanced capabilities layered on top of the reading experience: citation/figure popovers and an AI assistant.

> **Naming convention**: The application and Swift modules use `LyraReader`; Rust crates use
> `lyra-reader-*`, C ABI symbols use `lyra_reader_*`, and developer environment variables use
> `LYRA_READER_*`. See [rename compatibility](RENAMING.md) for existing user data.

Current status: **M1–M5 have working core paths and remain under active development**. The reader
opens real PDFs, rasterizes tiled pages off the main thread, and supports selection/search,
tabs, sidecar highlights/underlines/strikeouts/notes/ink/shapes, citation/figure/table/algorithm previews, and
document metadata recognition with per-field provenance plus BibTeX export.
Those annotations can be written back into a PDF: saving an annotated copy, or replacing the
original after a verified backup, adds, edits and deletes real PDF annotations through an
incremental save that leaves every untouched pre-existing annotation byte-identical. Annotations
another application wrote (Preview, Acrobat, anything) are editable and deletable too: they are
identified by `/NM` or a stable fallback, adopted into the same model, and written back without
losing their identity, popup, parent, reply links or flags.
Replacing the original also removes exactly the sidecar entries it saved, so nothing appears twice;
a saved copy carries no sidecar and shows each annotation once, from the file. An eraser removes
whole ink strokes only: a drag removes every stroke its path passes within reach of, the stroke a
press would remove is haloed first, one gesture is one undo step, and a saved copy simply omits the
erased strokes. Pages can be rotated,
deleted, reordered, inserted and extracted through a staged session whose undo covers the whole
session; the file on disk stays untouched until the reader applies the changes, and applying writes
a verified backup before replacing anything. Documents can also be merged and split into new files
without touching the source; the first document's outline survives a merge, and the reader's own
sidecar marks are remapped so they keep pointing at their pages. An optional AI assistant speaks the OpenAI-compatible
chat API, so a hosted service or a local Ollama works with nothing but a base URL, a model and a
key: it summarises a page or a long document, answers about a selection and translates one, previews
exactly what will be sent before anything leaves the machine, streams, cancels and retries, and keeps
the key in the Keychain rather than in any file or log.
At ordinary zoom, the reader presents one page raster at the screen's actual resolution and prepares
nearby pages on every scroll update; a facing-page mode shows page 1 alone and 2–3/4–5 spreads with a
configurable gap, and named user bookmarks ride in the same sidecar as the reader's annotations. Page rasters and tiles share the configured byte budget, so lower
zoom keeps more neighbors; larger pages and deep zoom use tiles. Already sharp tile rows stay sharp as
new regions load. A cold page can still show a preview until its raster arrives; this does not promise
zero-latency arbitrary jumps. What this replaced was measured rather than assumed: at 140% on a 2x
display the base held a blurry 1x raster for up to 26 consecutive canvas updates and took 84-88 ms per
page jump, and it never mixed a preview with pyramid tiles in one frame (0 mixed frames in 230 canvas
updates). Mixed sharp and blurry frames belong to the deep-zoom tile path here, which deliberately
paints complete sharp rows over a soft backdrop; that is the one present this reader still refines in
place.
Milestone acceptance criteria are not all met: the milestone table below names what is missing, and the
full review record (findings, evidence and follow-ups) is kept with the project's design notes rather than in
this repository. Concrete
fixes, validation evidence and outstanding work. PDFium remains serialized within a process;
background execution does not imply parallel PDFium rendering.

Capabilities, each backed by a check rather than a claim: selection and click-precise text, search,
tabs that switch without reloading and independent windows, outline with section numbers and levels, page
and annotation sidebars with reply threads, highlight/underline/strikethrough/ink/shape/sticky-note/text-box
creation with a colour and blend, and every one of those kinds written back into the PDF through a verified
incremental save; staged page editing; merge and split into new files; facing pages, page gap and bookmarks; a redaction that removes the
covered characters rather than covering them, and printing at print resolution; form filling bound to the
Fill & Sign slot and editable document properties; citation/figure/table/algorithm previews with draggable,
pinnable panels, open-in-a-second-window, a per-window Back for preview jumps, citation BibTeX copy,
transparent figure crops and text-only previews for section references; paper metadata with BibTeX export;
annotation export as Markdown or CSV; a persistent index
cache keyed by the document's bytes; and the AI assistant described above.
Known gaps are listed in the project's design notes: bookmarks are stored beside the PDF but not written into
its outline; text-markup geometry cannot be moved (it belongs to the text selection); `/Squiggly`, stamps
and annotations of a kind this reader does not model can be deleted but not edited; partial stroke
erasing, signature images, in-place text editing, AI document chat and region questions, and the Linux
and Windows shells remain.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1) Check the Rust side
cargo check --workspace

# 2) Build the Rust static library AND generate the UniFFI Swift bindings
#    (both are build artifacts and are not committed)
./scripts/build-rust.sh

# 3) Build and run the native macOS shell
cd apps/macos && swift build && swift run LyraReader
#    In a sandboxed shell (CI, agent runners) add --disable-sandbox: SwiftPM's nested
#    sandbox-exec is rejected there. scripts/check.sh retries automatically.
#    Tip: LYRA_READER_OPEN=/path/to.pdf swift run LyraReader opens a document at launch.
#    Dev hooks for headless checks (all optional, all logged on stderr):
#      LYRA_READER_ANNOTATE="x1,y1;x2,y2"  highlight the text between two content points
#      LYRA_READER_NOTE="text"             type into the first note, one keystroke at a time
#                                          (LYRA_READER_NOTE_INTERVAL_MS, LYRA_READER_NOTE_COMMIT=1)
#      LYRA_READER_RECOVER_SIDECAR=1       back up an unreadable sidecar and start fresh
#      LYRA_READER_QUIT_AFTER=<ms>         quit through the normal flush path
#    Sidecar writes are instrumented as `lyra-reader-annotate: saved N annotation(s) … write #K [trigger]`,
#    which is what makes note-write coalescing measurable (at most one write per ~500 ms of typing).
#    PDF write-back is instrumented as `lyra-reader-annotate: saved … to … (append N bytes)` and
#    `lyra-reader-annotate: replaced … , backup …`; the checks can run it alone with
#    `LyraReaderChecks --check-annotation-writeback .
#    Form filling, its cross-viewer evidence and the properties editor:
#    `LyraReaderChecks --check-forms .

# 3) Package a .app bundle
./scripts/make-app-bundle.sh          # output: build/LyraReader.app

# 4) Fetch and sign the PDFium dynamic library (needed for rendering)
./scripts/fetch-pdfium.sh

# 5) Generate the test fixtures (stdlib-only Python script)
python3 scripts/make-fixtures.py

# 6) Render a page and compare against a reference rasterizer
cargo run -p lyra-reader-cli -- info tests/fixtures/text-page.pdf
cargo run -p lyra-reader-cli -- render tests/fixtures/text-page.pdf --dpi 144 -o /tmp/page.png
pdftoppm -r 144 -png tests/fixtures/text-page.pdf /tmp/poppler
cargo run -p lyra-reader-cli -- compare /tmp/page.png /tmp/poppler-1.png --max-mae 1.0

# 7) See what a PDF somebody else annotated carries, page by page: subtype, /Rect, /QuadPoints
#    count, /C, /CA, the blend mode it is drawn with, /Contents, and the tint the canvas uploads
cargo run -p lyra-reader-cli -- annotations tests/fixtures/annotated-appearance.pdf

# 8) Recognise title/authors/venue/year/DOI/arXiv and print each field with its source
cargo run -p lyra-reader-cli -- metadata tests/fixtures/metadata-text-layer.pdf
```

## Page editing, merge and split

Rotate, delete, reorder, insert-blank and extract run through a staged session: every operation
is applied by the Rust engine to an in-memory copy, written to a temporary file, reopened and
verified (page count, per-page rotation, per-page size, and — for extraction — the selected
pages' text), then renamed into place. The file on disk changes only through **Save Edited Copy**
or **Replace Original**; replacing writes a verified byte-identical backup first. Undo/redo is a
stack of complete revisions, so deleting a page and undoing it restores the page's content rather
than approximating it.

**Merge** (`Pages > Append Pages from PDFs…`) and **Split** (`Pages > Split Pages…`) are
*immediate-to-a-new-file* commands, exactly like **Extract Selected Pages**: they read the file
that is open now (the working revision during a page-edit session), never end or alter the
session, are not undoable, and write new files only. Every output goes through the same
temporary-file / flush / reopen-and-verify / atomic-rename path; a source is never an output.

- **Outline rule.** A merge keeps the first document's outline exactly as it was (appending does
  not move its pages). It does **not** import the appended documents' outlines: PDFium's
  `FPDF_ImportPagesByIndex` copies page dictionaries, not a document-level bookmark tree, so the
  shell says "kept the first document's outline (N entries) and did not import M outline entries
  from the appended documents". A split writes no outline into its outputs, because the source
  outline's destinations can belong to different outputs; the reader's own bookmarks are
  remapped per output instead.
- **Marks rule.** The reader's annotations and bookmarks live in a sidecar keyed by page index.
  Merge appends at the end, so every page of the first document keeps its index and the existing
  marks keep pointing at it; the merged file gets a sidecar copy of exactly those marks. The
  appended pages are new indices and start with **no LyraReader sidecar marks**, because this app
  has no sidecar for the other documents (their file-owned annotations inside the PDF do travel
  with their pages and are counted in the confirmation). Split renumbers pages per output, so
  each output's sidecar holds the marks whose pages that file contains, at their new indices.
- **Refusals.** Merging a document into itself, selecting the same file twice, merging an
  encrypted PDF (including one that opens with an empty user password; the security-handler
  revision is checked), splitting an encrypted PDF, and any output that would overwrite an input
  are refused with a readable reason before anything is written. The self-merge and encrypted
  cases leave no PDF, sidecar or temporary behind.
- **Split failure model.** The whole plan (page indices, overlap between outputs, destination
  names) is validated before the first file is built. Outputs then go one at a time, each with
  its own verified atomic rename. If output *k* fails, outputs 1…*k*−1 are complete, valid files
  and stay in place; output *k* is not renamed (its temporary is removed); later outputs are not
  attempted; the source is untouched. The error and the alert say how many outputs are complete.
  The split is a sequence of atomic steps, not one transaction across files.
- **File names.** Merge offers `<name> (merged).pdf`. Split writes `<name> (pages 1-5).pdf`,
  `<name> (pages 6-10).pdf`, `<name> (page 11).pdf` (or the same shape from "every N pages"). The
  split dialog refuses to overwrite an existing file or sidecar before it starts. These dialogs
  and the generated names are the part that needs a human eye.

Evidence: `cargo test -p lyra-reader-pdfium page_ops` covers the engine round trips (boundary
text, appended annotations, outline kept/dropped, 5+5+1, refusals, and a failed third output);
`LyraReaderChecks --check-page-operations .` covers the shell's staged-session behaviour, the
sidecar remapping and the refusal/atomicity contracts end to end.

## Annotation write-back

The reader's highlights, underlines, strikeouts, notes and text boxes can be written into the PDF
itself, so another viewer sees them. Together with form filling and document properties (below),
these are the only code paths that write to a user's document, and every one of them is an
explicit command:

* **File ▸ Save Annotated Copy… (⌘S)** writes a new PDF (suggested name `<name> (annotated).pdf`).
  The open document and its sidecar are not touched. The copy has no sidecar, so reopening it
  shows each annotation once, from the file.
* **File ▸ Save and Replace Original… (⇧⌘S)** replaces the document. It first writes
  `<name>.lyra-reader-backup-<unix>-<n>.pdf`, verifies that the backup is byte-identical, and refuses to
  run if the backup cannot be written. The replacement itself is an atomic rename of a verified
  temporary file, so a crash leaves the original readable.

Both paths save **incrementally**: every original byte stays at its original offset and the new
objects are appended. Before the temporary file is renamed into place it is reopened and checked:
each written annotation must read back exactly once with its geometry, colour, opacity, contents,
author and date, and every annotation the file already carried must read back unchanged. The
sidecar's per-entry compatibility rules are untouched; a replace removes exactly the entries it
saved and preserves foreign entries, bookmarks and their order. If the sidecar update fails after
the PDF was written, reopening reconciles by `/NM` and shows the PDF's copy only.

**Editing and deleting annotations the file carries.** A highlight, underline, strikeout, sticky
note, free text, ink stroke, square, circle or line another application wrote is *adopted* into
the editable model when the reader selects it (a click on markup or a stroke, a double-click on a
note or text box, or the sidebar row). Adoption is a pending sidecar entry like any other: the PDF
on disk is untouched until an explicit save. The annotation is identified by `/NM`; when the file
carries none, a stable fingerprint is used and the writer assigns the sidecar's identity as `/NM`
on the first save, so later edits have a name to find. Editable fields are `/Contents`, `/C`,
`/CA`, `/M` and, where the kind has geometry the reader owns, the geometry: sticky notes, text
boxes, ink and shapes can be moved, a text box can be resized and reflowed, and a text mark's
`/Rect`/`/QuadPoints` are deliberately left alone because its geometry is the text selection's.
Replies are not edited directly; editing the parent leaves the `/IRT` chain, `/Popup`, `/Parent`,
`/F` flags, `/T`, `/Subj` and every unknown key untouched.

Deletion removes the annotation's reference from the page's `/Annots` in the same incremental
revision and takes its `/IRT` replies (transitively) and its `/Popup` window with it, so no reply
is left pointing at nothing. The objects remain in the file as unreachable bytes — an incremental
update cannot free an object — but they are no longer part of the document's annotation tree; a
full rewrite would drop them at the cost of invalidating signatures. Undo restores a deletion
made in the session before any save.

What is regenerated: a text mark's stale `/AP` is removed when its colour or opacity changes, so
viewers synthesize the new mark from `/C` (a comment-only edit keeps the producer's `/AP`).
`/FreeText` and the stroked kinds get a fresh appearance stream when a visual field changes; a
comment-only edit on ink or a shape keeps the producer's own appearance. `/Text` note appearances
are left untouched (their icon comes from `/Name`). What is preserved: `/NM` (or an assigned one),
`/Popup`, `/Parent`, `/IRT`, `/F`, `/T`, `/Subj`, `/Name`, `/Open`, `/IC`, `/DS` and every key this
reader does not model.

**Placing a text box.** With the Text Box tool armed, a double-click places a one-line box whose
top-left corner — and caret — is the click point, so a box placed beside a paragraph grows to the
right and down instead of covering the text it was placed next to. Dragging with the tool armed
does nothing. The box sizes itself to its text: its width follows the longest line and its height
the number of lines, and text does not wrap until a line would run off the page. A finished box
keeps that size, can be moved and resized by its handles, and opens for editing on a double-click.

**Appearance streams, and what to expect in Preview.** The text-markup writer
(highlight/underline/strikeout) does not write `/AP`. PDFium's C ABI has only one way to attach
one (`FPDFAnnot_SetAP`), and its generated `/ExtGState` is hard-coded to `/BM /Normal`; writing
that for a translucent highlight would tint the glyphs instead of multiplying into the page,
which is visibly worse than letting viewers synthesize the appearance. PDFKit — the engine
Preview uses — does synthesize it from `/QuadPoints` and `/C`: the regression suite renders a
saved copy with PDFKit and asserts that the highlight band is painted while the glyph pixels stay
black, and that a saved `/StrikeOut` is a line through the middle of its quad rather than a
filled box. PDFium (and therefore Chrome) does the same. A viewer that requires an explicit
appearance stream (some older readers) will not show any of these marks; that is the honest cost
of not writing a knowingly wrong blend mode. The reader reports such a file faithfully in its
sidebar either way, because the markup is in the dictionary. `/Text` notes are
written with `/Subtype /Text`, contents, author, date and colour, but PDFium exposes no setter for
the `/Name` icon, so viewers show their default note icon rather than `/Comment`. An opaque `/CA`
(1.0) is omitted by PDFium because absence already means fully opaque.

**Free-text appearance and CJK.** A `/FreeText` text box is written with a real `/AP /N` stream
whose text is a Type0/Identity-H CID font embedded with `FontFile2`, `CIDToGIDMap`, `/W` widths
and a `/ToUnicode` CMap. The font is a committed subset of **Noto Sans SC** (SIL OFL 1.1),
renamed **LyraReader Sans SC** because the OFL reserves the name “Source”, 3,628,760 bytes and 11,973
glyphs covering GB 2312, 6,878 of the 6,879 JIS X 0208 characters (≒ falls back), Latin, Greek
and the maths symbols papers use. It lives at `apps/macos/Resources/Fonts/` with its licence and ships in
`LyraReader.app/Contents/Resources/Fonts/`; it is not a system font. The writer subsets it again **per
document** to the glyphs the appearances actually use, so two text boxes share one font object and
a save appends kilobytes, not megabytes. Text extraction through the appearance's `/ToUnicode`
returns the exact string, including for a character outside the font: that character gets its own
CID, maps to `.notdef` (a visible missing-glyph box, never `?`) and keeps its exact Unicode in
`/ToUnicode`; `/Contents` is always exact, and the text editor warns while typing.

Ink, square, circle and line/arrow annotations are different: they have no blend-mode problem, so
LyraReader writes a real `/AP /N` Form XObject for them (the stroke path in the annotation's colour and
`/BS` width, with `/BS` matching what the stream draws) in addition to `/InkList` or `/L`/`/LE`.
PDFKit renders both the stroke and the shape from that file — the regression suite samples the
saved page and requires the ink's red pixels and the square's blue pixels inside their marks and
none away from them — and a viewer that ignores the appearance stream can still synthesize from
the geometry. A viewer that ignores **both** `/AP` and the geometry will show nothing; no such
viewer was observed here. Preview and Acrobat were not run for these kinds; PDFKit is the engine
named in the evidence.

`tests/fixtures/annotated-strokes.pdf` is the committed fixture for the reading side: its
`/InkList`, `/L`, `/LE`, `/BS` and `/AP` were hand-written by `scripts/make-fixtures.py`, not by
LyraReader. The reader must report the five marks as `ink`, `square`, `circle`, `line` and `arrow`, read
the ink's four points and the 3 pt `/BS`, treat `/LE [/None /ClosedArrow]` as an arrow, and draw
each from the dictionary (the appearance stream is there, but it is not the reader's source). The
native checks assert exactly that, including the Y flip.

**Ink and shape storage.** Their sidecar entries carry `"version": 1` and page-space geometry
(`paths`, `rect`, `lineStart`/`lineEnd`, `strokeWidth`). The page-space rule is what makes a mark
land in the same place at every zoom, and it is checked by drawing the same gesture at 100% and
300%. A build that does not know the geometry schema — an older LyraReader, or a newer build with a
higher version — preserves the entry verbatim instead of misreading it; that is the same
per-entry rule the sidecar has always used for colours and bookmarks.

**Crash recovery.** A save writes `<destination>.lyra-reader-save-<pid>-<n>.tmp` in the destination's
directory and removes the temporary on every error. On the next open, the reader reports any
leftover temporary in the status line; the document is intact because only the final rename makes
a save take effect. The next save removes the leftovers (the engine's
`interruptedSaveNote(at:)` is the detection point).

## Redaction that removes content

**Redaction tool** in the annotation row (or **Redaction ▸ Redact Tool**) arms a drag that marks a
rectangle. **Redaction ▸ Mark Selection for Redaction** turns the current text selection into one
rectangle per selected line. Marks are drawn on the page as a dark translucent fill with a dashed
red edge and a banner says how many are pending; they are not annotations and nothing has been
written yet. **Apply to Copy…** writes `<name> (redacted).pdf`, **Replace Original…** changes the
file on disk after a verified backup, and **Clear** throws the marks away. Both apply commands are
explicit and confirm what will be lost: area and page counts, the characters under the marks and
an excerpt of them, and how many vector/image objects they touch.

What "removal" covers, per page content stream:

* **Glyphs whose PDFium loose box intersects a mark are removed from the text-showing operator
  itself** (`Tj`, `TJ`, `'`, `"`). A `TJ` spacing adjustment replaces each removed run, so the
  surviving glyphs on that line stay where they were. Text outside the marks is untouched and
  stays extractable.
* **Vector paths whose painted bounding box intersects a mark lose their painting operator.** The
  whole path is removed even when only part of it intersects; this is observable, because a stroke
  that continues beyond the black mark disappears too.
* **Images and form XObjects whose placed bounding box intersects a mark are removed as whole
  objects.**
* **A page that cannot be attributed is rasterised** at 300 dpi with the marks burned in black and
  its content replaced by that one image. This happens when the text layer cannot be mapped
  one-to-one onto the page's text operators (text inside a form XObject is the common case) or
  when the page contains inline images or shadings. Rasterising loses **the whole page's text
  layer**, which is why the confirmation says so and why the preview counts the characters.
* Every mark is finally painted with a black fill rectangle, so the saved page shows it. (The
  rasterised fallback burns the same rectangle into the image.)

The output is a **complete rewritten document**: page content streams are replaced and
`prune_objects` drops the unreferenced old streams, so the removed text is not left in the file's
prefix as an unreferenced object. Encrypted documents are refused rather than silently decrypted.

**Safety.** A copy may not be the source. The replace path writes
`<name>.lyra-reader-backup-<unix>-<n>.pdf`, verifies it byte-for-byte, and refuses to run if it cannot be
written; the replacement is then an atomic rename of a temporary file that has already been
reopened and verified. On any error the original is untouched.

**Proof.** The writer reopens its own output and refuses to rename it unless: the page count is
unchanged, **no extractable character intersects any mark**, the characters outside every mark are
exactly the ones that were outside it before (whitespace is compared loosely because removing a run
leaves a gap that extractors may fill with a space), and the centre of every mark renders black.
The same proof is available by hand:

```bash
# What will be removed (PDF user space, origin bottom-left)
cargo run -p lyra-reader-cli -- redact page.pdf --rect 158,687,32,14 --preview

# Write a redacted copy (the original is not touched)
cargo run -p lyra-reader-cli -- redact page.pdf --rect 158,687,32,14 -o redacted.pdf

# Prove it from another extractor, not from LyraReader
pdftotext redacted.pdf - | grep -c brown   # 0: gone
pdftotext page.pdf    - | grep -c brown    # 1: still in the original
pdftotext redacted.pdf -                    # the rest of the line/paragraph is still there
```

The native check `LyraReaderChecks --check-redaction .` runs the same path through the real engine
and FFI: it removes the word `brown` from the fixture copy while `quick`, `jumps`, the title and
the last line still extract; samples the black mark; redacts a small area inside the fixture's
long blue vector rule and requires the rule's pixels *outside* the mark to turn white (the path
was removed, not painted over); replaces a copy and checks the byte-identical backup; and exercises
the pending-mark model the canvas and confirmation use. The Rust tests in
`crates/lyra-reader-pdfium/src/redaction.rs` additionally cover the rasterised fallback on a page
whose text lives in a form XObject (all page text gone, mark black, `rasterized: true`).

**Limits.** The raster fallback refuses a rotated page rather than writing an image with the wrong
orientation; text glyph removal itself operates on the page's text operators and has no such
restriction. Page annotations already in the PDF (`/Annots`, e.g. somebody's highlight or a form
field) are not page content and are left alone; their dictionaries are not covered by the text
extraction proof. Mixed crop boxes and non-identity page rotations have not been exercised by the
native checks.

## Printing

**File ▸ Print… (⌘P)** runs a normal `NSPrintOperation` over `ReaderPrintView`. The print panel is
the system's, so the page range and the copy count are its own; the view supplies the document's
page count through `knowsPageRange`, and AppKit only calls it for the selected pages. Each page is
rasterised **at 300 dpi** (4.17× the 72 dpi page geometry, more than twice a Retina screen raster)
when the print system asks for it. The page raster is produced with the PDF's own annotations
burned in (the thumbnail path), and the reader's own highlights, underlines, strikeouts, ink,
shapes, lines/arrows, sticky notes and text boxes are drawn on top in page coordinates: highlights
are multiplied into the page at their stored colour and opacity, strokes keep their width and
colour, and a text box prints its text.

Only the page being drawn and the one just drawn are cached (`ReaderPrintView.maximumCachedPages`
= 2). A 900-page document prints one page at a time; nothing loads the document's pages into
memory up front. Text layers needed by highlights are loaded before the print panel appears.

`LyraReaderChecks --check-printing .` inspects the same view headlessly (no printer, no dialog):
`knowsPageRange` reports 3 pages for `multipage.pdf` and 130 for `index-past-120.pdf`; a one-page
range selects exactly `[0]`, a five-page range of the 130-page document selects exactly
`[9,10,11,12,13]`, each rendered bitmap is 300 dpi, the reader's red ink and yellow highlight are
sampled in the bitmap, and the cache never exceeds two pages while five are printed. The print
panel's `firstPage`/`lastPage`/`copies` attributes are carried by the operation.

**Limits.** The paper size is set to the first page's size (the page-setup panel can still change
it), so a mixed-size PDF prints every page into that paper rectangle. The print view rasterises
rather than sending vector content; 300 dpi is the resolution it promises. The mirror surface
(Metal) is not involved in the print path at all.

**Needs a human eye.** The redaction drag's feel and the dashed pending style; the confirmation
wording and layout at 100% and with many marks; how the black mark looks against a real paper's
text at 100%/200%; and the printed sheet itself — colour, highlight multiply behaviour on the real
printer, margin fit and whether a mixed-size document needs per-page paper. These are visual
judgements the headless checks cannot make.

## Annotation text export

**File ▸ Export Annotations… (⌘E)** writes the annotations to a separate Markdown (`.md`) or CSV
(`.csv`) file chosen in the save panel; the suggested name is `<name> (annotations).md`/`.csv`.
Both the reader's own annotations (from the sidecar) and the annotations the PDF already carries
are included, each labelled with its source. The export is in document order — page, then vertical
position, then creation time — with `/IRT` replies nested under their parent, and the file's own
date (its `/M`) is used because a PDF annotation has no creation date. Markdown quotes are full
blockquotes rather than truncated lines; CSV uses RFC 4180 quoting and keeps embedded commas,
double quotes and newlines. This is a local file write with the same atomic discipline as the
sidecar (a temporary file renamed into place), and a document with no annotations produces no file
and says so.

## Form filling and document properties

**Fill & Sign** is an explicit mode, bound to the toolbar's former placeholder. With it on, a click
on a widget edits it; with it off the overlay is transparent to the mouse and the keyboard, so text
selection, links and scrolling are exactly what they were. Choosing any annotation tool leaves the
form tool (the reverse is also true), and pressing Escape in a field leaves the field; Escape on the
page leaves the tool. The reader never writes while the reader types: values are staged in the
reader, the page-edit banner's language is reused for "Form changes pending · the file on disk is
unchanged", and only **Save Filled Form Copy…** or **Write Form Values to Original…** writes a file.

* **Reading the fields.** PDFium's public form API has no field enumeration (it is an event/render
  API: `FORM_OnChar`, `FPDF_FFLDraw`), so the engine reads the widget dictionaries with `lopdf`:
  `/AcroForm` → `/Fields`, the `/Kids` hierarchy, inherited `/FT`, `/Ff`, `/V`, `/Opt`, `/DA`,
  and each page's `/Annots`. The page's `/CropBox`, `/Rotate` and `/UserUnit` map every widget
  `/Rect` into view space through the same single Y-flip annotations use. Text fields, check
  boxes, radio groups, combo boxes, list boxes and signature fields are reported; a signature is
  a distinct kind and is not editable. A widget that is itself the field (the shape most
  producers write) and a field whose widgets are `/Kids` are both accepted, and so are files
  where `/AcroForm` and the page annotations hold separate copies (PDFKit writes that shape).
* **Drawing.** A SwiftUI overlay draws the reader's chrome over the Metal raster at the widget
  rectangle: a light border, an accent border and wash once a value is present, a real focus
  ring, a drawn check mark, a radio dot, a drop-down chevron and an in-place list. The text
  editor is a real `NSTextField` (caret, selection, IME), sized to the zoom; Tab and Shift-Tab
  move in page/top/left reading order, Return advances and Escape leaves the field.
* **Saving.** The writer is an incremental revision through the same contract as annotation
  saves: the original bytes stay the prefix, the field and widget dictionaries are cloned,
  `/V` and `/AS` are set, appearance streams are generated (using the bundled CJK font subset,
  so a name in Chinese is a real glyph rather than `?`), the temporary file is flushed,
  `fsync`ed, reopened, every changed value is read back, every untouched field and the page
  annotation counts are verified unchanged, and only then is the file renamed into place. The
  replace action writes and verifies a byte-identical backup first. **Widgets stay
  interactive**: `/AcroForm`, `/Fields`, the widget dictionaries and their `/AP` are kept. The
  generated appearance is what makes the same file show its values in PDFKit, Poppler and
  Ghostscript.
* **Evidence.** `tests/fixtures/form-fields.pdf` (two pages, eight fields, generated by
  `scripts/make-fixtures.py`) carries values written by the generator; `form-fields-encrypted.pdf`
  is the same form with an empty user password. `LyraReaderChecks --check-forms .` reads the
  fixture's types, rectangles and values, fills six fields through `AppState`, saves a copy, reads
  it back with this engine, with PDFKit's widget model and renderer (text ink, check-mark pixels),
  with Poppler's `pdftotext` and with Ghostscript's `txtwrite`; it also fills a copy with
  **PDFKit itself** and reads that back here. The encrypted fixture is refused with the reason
  shown in the UI, and the check asserts that no file was written.

**Document Information** (View ▸ Document Information…, ⌥⌘I) now also edits the PDF's own
information dictionary: Title, Author, Subject and Keywords, with page count, PDF version and
encryption shown as read-only facts. **Save Copy…** writes the four entries into a new PDF;
**Write to This File…** backs the original up and replaces it. Both use the verified incremental
save above and read the entries back before the rename. An encrypted document is refused with a
readable reason instead of being written without its security envelope. This section is the
`/Info` dictionary itself; the recognised-metadata section below remains a separate, layout-based
reading, and XMP remains its highest-priority source.

## Document metadata and BibTeX

The Document Information window (View > Document Information…, ⌥⌘I; also `lyra-reader-cli metadata <file.pdf>`) reads the open document
offline, in this priority order:

1. **XMP** — `dc:title`, `dc:creator`, `prism:doi`, `prism:publicationName`, `prism:coverDate`;
2. **the `/Info` dictionary** — `/Title`, `/Author`, and `/Subject`/`/Keywords` as a place a DOI is
   sometimes parked;
3. **page one's text layer** — the largest text above the abstract (title block), the author line
   below it, and identifiers/venue/year from the page furniture.

Every field carries its source, and the panel marks layout-derived values as **Guessed**. An empty
field stays empty: the recogniser has no filename, creation-date or "Anonymous" fallback, so a
scanned page or a paper with no text layer produces no metadata rather than plausible-looking
metadata. The DOI (`10.\d{4,9}/…`) and arXiv id (`arXiv:2303.08774`, `2303.08774v2`) are found in
page-one text and reported as identified, not guessed.

The same values generate the BibTeX entry: `@article` for a journal venue, `@inproceedings` for a
conference/proceedings venue, `@misc` when there is no venue (including arXiv preprints, with
`eprint`/`archivePrefix`). The key is author/year/title, field values are brace-wrapped and LaTeX
escaped (`& % _ # $ ~ ^ \`, balanced `{…}` groups preserved, common Latin diacritics translated to
accent commands), and URLs in `url`/`doi` are not text-escaped. **Copy BibTeX (⇧⌘B)** and
**Save BibTeX…** both use exactly the string the panel shows, including any corrections the reader
made; a correction changes the field's source to `Edited`.

The accuracy of the recognition is measured in the pull request that introduced it: the title,
author, venue, year and DOI of the twelve sample papers and seven review PDFs were compared by hand
with the produced fields, and the fixtures `metadata-embedded.pdf`, `metadata-info.pdf`,
`metadata-text-layer.pdf` and `metadata-arxiv.pdf` pin the known answers (XMP priority, `/Info`
fallback, page-one fallback, arXiv-only) in `crates/lyra-reader-cli/tests/metadata_fixtures.rs` and
`apps/macos/Checks/MetadataChecks.swift`.

## Reader interface

LyraReader follows the system appearance with a warm cream/gold light palette and warm charcoal dark
palette. Document tabs share the top window row with the native window controls; the separate
native title strip is hidden and the empty tab-bar area moves the window. The native window
buttons are centred vertically in that row, with the new-tab button following the document tabs.
Inactive tabs have vertical separators. Tabs start at a fixed 250pt width and share the available space equally when the row fills;
very large tab sets scroll horizontally at a readable minimum width.
Toolbar drop-downs open below their controls in compact LyraReader panels; document and thumbnail
context menus use the same styling. Icons, grouped commands, hover states, and
arrow-key/Return/Escape navigation are supported. The second toolbar button opens a full-window
page overview with adaptive thumbnails, selection, reordering and page operations. Double-click
a page to return to reading, or choose Done; the sidebar remains a separate control.
The tab row is followed by grouped view/zoom controls,
annotation tools, page operations, export, AI, and search. **Annotate** expands a second row for
highlights, underlines, strikethrough, selection notes, and six LyraReader color presets. Existing indexed sidecar
colors retain their original values. Tools that are not implemented yet are disabled in their
reserved positions.
**View > Paper Appearance** offers Original Colours, Warm Paper and Night Reading. Warm Paper
uses cream paper and warm ink; Night Reading uses charcoal paper, subdued gray text and grayscale
page content/annotations. These conversions happen only when drawing: cached source rasters,
annotation colours, the PDF and exported copies remain unchanged. Original Colours restores the
source appearance. The preference is remembered across launches and applies to reading canvases,
previews and thumbnail displays.
The empty Home page offers an open/drop area followed by Recents, Clear and View All; the complete
Recents grid has a Back button. Covers are cached from already-open documents, so showing history
does not reopen protected or missing source PDFs. Search opens a separate right sidebar grouped by
page, with matching terms highlighted and previous/next controls. Left navigation uses horizontal
Bookmarks, Outline, Annotations, Thumbnails and AI icons; metadata editing and BibTeX live in
Document Information.
Preview windows are native children of their reader window and fit each new preview's content,
while still allowing manual dragging/resizing for that preview. Esc works from the reader or the
preview immediately. Citation previews retain the clicked citation as their top header, use the
paper title as the entry heading when a clear title sentence can be extracted (otherwise
“Reference”), and show the complete entry. Figure/table previews show the raster crop's caption
without duplicating it as plain text.

The preview header carries **Pin**, **Open in New Window** and **Close**. Pinning freezes the
panel on the preview it was pinned to: a click elsewhere in the document that would normally
replace it is refused (the status line says why), and unpinning re-arms the ordinary update so the
next preview replaces it. Every preview kind can be pinned; a pinned panel keeps its position and
size. **Open in New Window** asks the existing window registry for a second, independent reader
window, opens the same document there and scrolls to the preview's page and region (a figure or
table crop, a cited entry's fragment, or a page top). It is a second window rather than an
in-window split because the reader window has one canvas and no split layout; the source window
keeps its page, scroll offset, tabs and open preview. A citation preview's **Copy BibTeX** copies
exactly the open document's generated entry — the same string Document Information copies — and is
absent for page, figure and section previews; when the document has no generated entry the action
is disabled and says so rather than inventing a citation. Each citation entry also has an explicit
copy menu for its text and, when available, that BibTeX entry.

Settings > Performance uses a grouped, wrapping layout for engine information and cache controls.

## AI assistant (ChatGPT plan or API key)

In **Settings > AI > Use AI with**, choose one connection:

- **ChatGPT plan:** press **Continue with ChatGPT**, finish the browser sign-in, and authorize
  LyraReader to use your eligible ChatGPT plan. Choose a model from your account's catalog. Each saved
  connection keeps its own client registration and validated identity; **Add Account** creates
  another connection. **Manage usage in ChatGPT** opens the page for reviewing shared plan usage
  and app limits. Availability and remaining allowance depend on the account and plan.
- **API key:** the existing OpenAI-compatible endpoint, model, reasoning settings, and Keychain
  API key continue to work for hosted providers and local services.

ChatGPT connections use OpenAI's official [open-source Sign in with ChatGPT flow](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/sign-in):
loopback callback, PKCE, state/nonce validation, and RS256 identity signature verification against
OpenAI's published keys. Credentials stay in the macOS Keychain and refresh tokens rotate atomically.
Sign Out cancels active requests, attempts remote revocation, and clears credentials; if remote
revocation cannot be confirmed, LyraReader points to ChatGPT Settings to disconnect the app.

ChatGPT inference uses the public Responses API with `store: false` and `stream: true`, as required
by the [official inference contract](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source/models-and-inference).
It uses no Codex credentials, private ChatGPT endpoints, or API key fallback. Requests retain the
existing local context preview and explicit Send step. Changing the connection after preparing a
preview requires a fresh preview. Streamed usage-limit errors, incomplete answers, and interrupted
connections are failures with the partial answer preserved. Only `response.completed` completes a
request. The initial account/model discovery happens when connecting or refreshing the catalog;
PDF text is sent only after Send. Browser sign-in and a live eligible account are still required
to validate real subscription access; automated tests use synthetic credentials and mocked HTTP.

### API key connection

The API key connection in the AI sidebar speaks the
OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` protocol — a base URL, a model name, and an API key — so the
same code works with OpenAI, DeepSeek, and a local Ollama
(`http://localhost:11434/v1`, any non-empty key). No vendor SDK is used.

**What it does.** Summarise the current page, summarise the whole document (split into parts for
long documents), ask a question about the current selection, and translate the selection. For a
long document, the per-part answers are kept, and a **separate consolidation request** is
previewed after the parts with its own page/character/token cost. Sending it produces the single
summary shown as the answer; it is never sent automatically, and if a part is missing the panel
names that part instead of silently consolidating the rest. Every answer streams. While streaming,
Cancel aborts the HTTP request and keeps the partial answer; Retry re-sends the plan that was
already previewed. Token usage is shown when the provider reports it. Answers are rendered as paragraphs, headings,
bullet lists and numbered lists; the model is instructed to cite sources as `[p.N]`, and only
that exact form with an in-range page becomes a clickable page jump. Bare numbers, `[12]`,
`[p.12–14]` and out-of-range pages stay plain text.

**Reasoning control.** Plain OpenAI compatibility has no standard reasoning switch, but the
provider exposes several request extensions. Settings > AI has two controls: a **mode**
(`provider default`, `off`, `low`, `high`, `max`) and an **encoding** (`none`, `thinking`,
`reasoning_effort`, `output_config`, `reasoning.effort`). The default is **off via thinking**
(`{"thinking":{"type":"disabled"}}`), because reasoning changes cost and latency. LyraReader sends
exactly one chosen field and nothing else; unsupported combinations (such as an intensity with
the thinking toggle, or `off` via `output_config`) are rejected in Settings rather than silently
sending a different value. The request preview states in plain words what is sent
("Thinking: disabled" / "Reasoning effort: high") and shows the exact JSON body. If a provider
returns a 4xx naming an unknown or unsupported parameter, the error quotes it and points back at
the reasoning setting. The completion budget (`max_tokens`) is shown in the same preview and
remains user-editable; it is not silently raised.

`usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` (or a top-level `reasoning_tokens`) is
displayed as a subset of completion tokens. If the provider reports reasoning tokens when the
mode is `off`, the answer footer says so: the provider may have ignored the toggle.

**Reasoning is not the answer.** DeepSeek's thinking-mode models stream their analysis in
`choices[0].delta.reasoning_content` (the [DeepSeek streaming guide](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/thinking_mode_api_example_streaming/)
shows a chunk carrying either `reasoning_content` or `content`). LyraReader accumulates that channel
separately and never concatenates it into the answer, the translation, or the page linkifier.
If a stream ends with no content but the provider reported usage, the panel says so explicitly,
names `finish_reason` and the frame/delta counts, shows the HTTP status, content shape, byte
count and usage, and puts the reasoning in a labelled, obviously-not-the-answer section. A
`finish_reason: "length"` with no content says "The provider stopped at its token limit before
answering." A usage-only stream gets the same diagnostic; the usage line is deliberately small
and muted below it, never the headline. The reasoning text is not linkified.

**Other response shapes.** A streaming delta may carry `content` as an array of text parts
(`[{"type":"text","text":…}]`); those are concatenated in order. If a gateway ignores
`stream: true` and returns one ordinary JSON response, it is parsed as
`choices[0].message.content` (plus optional usage) rather than failing for a missing `[DONE]`.
A 200 response whose body is an `error` object is surfaced as the provider's `error.message`,
not as an empty success. `stream_options` is never sent, and the model name is passed through
exactly as typed (no catalogue validation or remapping); an endpoint error is shown to the
reader.

**Selection exactness and the line-number gutter.** The AI prompt slices the raw page text with
the same `TextChar` indices the canvas uses for drawing and copy. Page text is normalised only
for the surrounding page context and retrieval, never before extracting a selection: CRLF→LF and
whitespace changes would shift the range (the manuscript's `000`–`053` margin made that shift
very visible). Whatever the reader highlights is what the model receives, including partial words
at either edge and any internal whitespace; no word-boundary trimming is applied.

For page and document context, a **leading margin line-number block** is removed by a geometric
rule, not by stripping digits: the text layer must begin with at least five consecutive lines
that contain only digits, share an aligned equal-width column whose values increase by exactly
one, sit within 40 pt of the page's left text edge, and have a visible gap before the body.
Numbered list items and table rows carry other text on the same line, so they are left alone.
The committed `selection-numbered-margin.pdf` fixture and the local `manuscript_0925.pdf` prove
the page context has no `000`–`053` run while the abstract and the exact selected characters
survive.

**What it does not do, and says so.** No document chat, no region screenshots/vision, no
auto-retry, no background requests, and no automatic consolidation. A scanned PDF with no text
layer gets a clear message rather than a fabricated answer. The panel renders only the small
Markdown subset above; other Markdown is shown literally.

**Where the code lives.** The platform-independent half is Rust (`crates/lyra-reader-ai`):
settings validation, page/block selection and BM25-style retrieval, prompt assembly, the exact
request body, the HTTP request, incremental SSE parsing, timeouts, cancellation and HTTP
status/API-error-body parsing. It is tested with a real loopback mock HTTP server. A
deterministic mock provider (preset strings, no socket) lets the Swift panel checks run without a
network. The Swift shell (`apps/macos`) owns the panel, the settings form, the request preview,
the Keychain, the answer renderer, and a polling handle over UniFFI (`startAiRequest` returns an
`LyraReaderAiRequest`; `poll()` returns delta/usage/done/error events and `cancel()` stops the worker).

**Credential storage is the one per-platform piece.** The macOS shell implements this four-method
protocol (`AIAPIKeyStore` in `AIAssistantTypes.swift`):

```swift
readKey() -> String?
saveKey(_ key: String)
deleteKey()
hasKey() -> Bool
```

macOS uses a generic-password item in the login Keychain (service `com.alex.lyrareader.ai`, account
`openai-compatible-api-key`). A Windows shell should implement the same four methods with
Credential Manager/DPAPI; a Linux shell with the Secret Service. The key is read from the store
only when the reader presses Send, passed across the FFI for that one request, moved into the
worker thread, and dropped when the request ends. Rust does not store, persist, or log it, and
the plan/record types cannot carry it. Error bodies and debug output redact the key. The request
preview shows every system/user message and the exact JSON body (plus a redacted
`Authorization: Bearer <redacted until you press Send>`), so the reader can see what would leave
the machine before anything is sent.

**Transport and trust roots.** One in-process client (`ureq` 3.4.2 over `rustls` 0.23) handles
both `http://` and `https://`; there is no shell-out and no external program is required.
The loopback tests and the app therefore exercise the same connection, TLS, timeout, body-reader
and SSE code. Root certificates come from the operating system through `rustls-native-certs`
(Security.framework on macOS, schannel on Windows, the platform OpenSSL paths on Linux), so
OS-managed corporate roots work. The standard `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY`
environment variables are honoured by ureq's default connector; the macOS Network-pane proxy
settings are not read. If the platform store yields no certificates, the
client falls back to ureq's bundled Mozilla roots (`webpki-roots`, CDLA-Permissive-2.0); if
neither is usable the TLS handshake fails and the provider's certificate error is shown. Roots
are cached for the process.

Because ureq is synchronous, cancellation is handled below it: a small transport adapter passed
to ureq's connector wraps the real connection and bounds every blocking read to 100 ms or the
remaining idle budget. Between those short reads it checks the request's cancel flag and the
real idle (60 s) and total (300 s) deadlines. Cancel therefore returns promptly even when a
provider has stopped sending; the connection is dropped and the reader sees `Cancelled` rather
than waiting for the next token. The same adapter enforces the idle timeout for response headers
and for the SSE body.

**Protocol.** `POST {base}/chat/completions` with
`Content-Type: application/json`, `Accept: text/event-stream`,
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` and `User-Agent: LyraReader/0.0`. The body contains `model`, `messages`
(system + user), `stream: true`, and optionally `temperature`, `max_tokens` and exactly one
reasoning extension. The response is parsed as SSE: each `data:` line is JSON,
`choices[0].delta.content` and `delta.reasoning_content` are accumulated in separate channels,
`choices[0].finish_reason` is recorded, an optional `usage` object (including reasoning-token
details) is shown, `[DONE]` ends the request, and EOF without `[DONE]` is an error. Every request
also produces a diagnostics record: HTTP status, bytes, frame/data counts, content/reasoning/
role-only/empty frame counts, content shape (string, array, complete JSON or none), finish reason
and usage. HTTP status and the provider's JSON error message are surfaced as readable text; 401
points at the Keychain setting and an unsupported reasoning parameter points at Settings > AI.
`stream_options` is not sent, so token usage appears only when a provider reports it in its
stream.

**Raw-stream trace.** Set `LYRA_READER_AI_TRACE=1` (any non-empty value except `0`) to print one
`lyra-reader-ai-trace:` line per response frame and one `request summary` line per request to stderr.
Each frame line names the frame type (`data` or `done`), the JSON keys it carried, and character
counts for content/reasoning. The summary has HTTP status, bytes, frame/data counts, delta-kind
counts, content shape, `finish_reason`, usage (including reasoning tokens) and no content
values. It never prints header values, the Authorization header, document text, answer text or
reasoning text; it is safe to send the log when asking why a provider produced no answer. The
environment variable is read once per process.

**Tests.** `cargo test -p lyra-reader-ai` covers split JSON across SSE chunks, `[DONE]`, HTTP
401 with an error body, a mid-stream disconnect, cancellation (the loopback server observes the
connection closing), idle timeouts, and that the wire body equals the previewed body. The TLS
path is tested with a loopback `rustls` server and a generated CA: a full streaming round trip
with the CA injected into the client's roots, and a refusal when the server's certificate is
signed by a different CA. Stream fixtures cover content-only, reasoning-then-content, content
array, usage-only, a `finish_reason: "length"` stop with no content, non-SSE complete JSON and a
200 error body. The raw-selection and gutter regressions are checked against a committed
numbered-margin fixture (and the live manuscript when the local corpus is mounted): canvas hit
testing, copy and both prompt paths must produce identical characters, while page context loses
the margin run and keeps the abstract. Consolidation tests cover the one-request merge, its
prompt/cost, and a missing part naming the gap.
`LyraReaderChecks --check-ai-assistant .` covers settings validation, Keychain-hygiene (the key
never appears in UserDefaults or captured stdout/stderr; a real Keychain round-trip runs when the
login Keychain is available and is skipped, not faked, when it is not), the citation rules, the
reasoning settings, reasoning/empty-answer panel state, the truncated-at-limit message, the
four-action request profile (same model/temperature/max_tokens/stream/reasoning field, only
prompts differ), and the part-summary consolidation flow with the Rust mock provider. No check
makes a real API call.

## Development workflow

This repository is trunk-based. A push to `master` runs CI; a **pull request** is used when a gate
before merging earns its ceremony, which is decided by what the change does rather than by who wrote
it:

**Straight to `master`** — additive, self-contained work that does not change the behaviour of an
existing code path: new modules or functions, tests, documentation, milestone and task lists, CI
configuration. Code produced by an automated agent lands this way too, once it has been verified.

**Through a pull request** — anything that changes existing behaviour: bug fixes, performance work,
refactors, model or FFI signature changes, and anything touching the rendering, annotation or
selection paths. Also use one for work that lands in pieces, for a new subsystem whose blast radius
is not yet known, and for **anything done while another session is working in this repository** —
that last case is what genuinely needs it, because a pull request is checked against the **merge
result**, and an integration regression between two in-flight branches is invisible to either
branch's own checks.

Prefer a **merge commit** for a pull request whose individual commits carry meaning; squash only when
the branch is a single commit or its history is noise.

## Reproducing measurements

Any requested benchmark phase failure returns a nonzero exit status, including with
`--skip-baseline`. The CLI benchmark models CPU raster work and a settled prefetch band. It finishes every
step's prefetch before advancing, so zero visible misses do **not** establish zero waiting
under continuous scrolling. It does not measure GPU time or presented frame rate.

**Presentation timestamps depend on the display being awake and the window unoccluded.** With the display
awake the harness measures real presented frames (46.81 and 43.11 fps on a real paper during a scripted
scroll); with the display asleep or the window occluded every drawable's Metal `presentedTime` comes back
as zero (436 of 436 in the harness, 297 of 297 in a minimal `CAMetalLayer`
probe), so a trace reporting `presented_fps: 0.0` is not evidence of a frame-pacing problem — and not
evidence of anything else either. Treat an all-zero presentation trace as "not measured", never as 0 fps:
the harness reports it as `presentation_measurement: "unavailable"` with a `presentation_measurement_reason`
and `presented_fps: null`, never as an fps together with a status of `"complete"`.
The application-side harness also drives the scroll model on a 16.67 ms cadence rather than delivering
real wheel or trackpad events, and reaches about 53 inputs per second, so it cannot demonstrate 60 fps
even where timestamps work. The project's "stable 60 fps" criterion therefore remains **unproven**, not
failed.

**Record the surface size and scale with any memory or frame figure**: earlier medians were taken on a
1918x1430 scale-2.0 surface and later runs on a 959x715 scale-1.0 one, and the two are not comparable;
a real-paper raster p95 of 13.7-14.5 ms likewise did not reproduce in either arm of a later A/B (20-40 ms). The default
48 MiB cache gives the prefetch band a 16 MiB target (one third, with an 8 MiB floor); the
minimum ring can still exceed that target. Record the commit, PDFium version, input PDF,
command, build profile and hardware with each result.

**The cache figure names what it covers.** The 48 MiB budget is shared by tiles and whole-page rasters;
sidebar thumbnails and text layers are held outside it. `lyra-reader-stats:` therefore prints
`tiles X/Y MiB`, `pageRasters Z MiB` and `shared X+Z/Y MiB` — the number the budget actually bounds —
followed by `thumbnails`, `text` and `rasters total` for what it does not, and `lyra-reader-band:` uses the
same names. On the real 115-page paper at 140% the line used to read `cache 0 tiles · 0.0/48.0 MiB`
while three 14.5 MiB page rasters were resident: 43.5 MiB of page rasters + 8.3 MiB of thumbnails +
0.5 MiB of text = 52.3 MiB held, of which the budget covered the 43.5 MiB of page rasters and none of
the rest. The verification's own accounting on its 140% run was 48 MiB of budgeted rasters + 7.2 MiB of
thumbnails + 1.4 MiB of text = 52.1 MiB. Peak RSS is unaffected by the wording; it stayed in the same
460-499 MiB band across three runs before and three runs after.

```bash
cargo run --release -p lyra-reader-cli -- bench tests/fixtures/multipage.pdf
./scripts/fetch-eval-papers.sh
LYRA_READER_REQUIRE_FULL_EVAL=1 cargo test -p lyra-reader-cli --test reference_eval -- --ignored --nocapture
```

`LYRA_READER_EVAL_PAPERS` can point at an existing corpus. Without strict mode, local evaluation
may use a partial corpus or explicitly skip an absent one; so does the GPT-3 gold check, which
needs one PDF rather than the corpus and announces its own absence with a `::notice::` instead of
failing. Every mode fails if a present PDF cannot be opened or a page's text cannot be extracted.
Manual CI with `fetch_eval_papers=true` requires all listed PDFs; PDFium download failure fails
the macOS gate. CI decides whether to evaluate by looking at whether `eval-papers/*.pdf` exists,
not by a step's outcome, so a corpus that is already on the workspace is measured rather than
reported as absent. CI preserves check and evaluation logs as `macos-check-logs` artifacts,
including on failure.

**The screen-resolution page path is not always available, and says so when it is not.** It needs one
page raster of at most `min(cache budget / 2, 32 MiB)`, at most 8192 px on the page's longest side, at
most seven pages on screen, and the on-screen pages' rasters together inside the whole budget. A US
Letter page at 140% on a 2x display is 1714x2218 px = 14.5 MiB, so a cache budget below 29.0 MiB
(30 MiB as the first whole-MiB setting that fits) turns the path off and falls back to tiles. That is
announced rather than silent: stderr gets one `lyra-reader-screen-page: off: ...` line per change naming the
limit that failed and the budget it needs, `LYRA_READER_RENDER_STATS=1` carries
`screenPages off(page 14.5>8.0 MiB; budget <29.0 MiB)` (or `on`, or `off(feature-off)` for
`LYRA_READER_SHARP_PAGE_RASTERS=0`), and `AppState.screenPagePathNote` exposes the same reason to the
UI. The four thresholds are stated in `screenPagePathDecision`.

The evaluation's historical “recall” column is **resolution rate among detected spans**, not
citation-detection recall: undetected styles never enter its denominator, and a grouped span
counts as resolved if any label resolves (partial groups are reported separately). The table also
prints the body-page window each paper was measured over, because that window moves when the
bibliography parser selects the list differently — GPT-3's went from 69 pages to 67 — and recall is
a ratio over it, so two runs are comparable only when their windows match. It also prints the
longest bibliography entry each paper parsed and how many entries exceed a plausibility bound of
1800 characters, and fails a paper that goes past its pinned ceiling: that is the shape T4.17 had,
when GPT-3 parsed as six entries of 3000–7831 characters instead of 144, so a collapse comes back
as a failing evaluation rather than as a number that merely looks odd. The four measured entries
above the bound are pinned at their measured lengths instead of being cut, because they are the
last reference of a list absorbing the section printed after it on the same page, and the obvious
repair — ending an entry at a paragraph gap — truncates legitimate wrapped lines. The
heuristic precision audit is review evidence, not a measured false-positive rate. A small
independently annotated GPT-3 gold set checks complete detection on three full pages and proves
each of the 18 labels resolves to the entry that names the annotated first author: the surname must
be one of the entry's opening words, and the year encoded in the citation key must label the same
entry. Both are checks the resolver cannot satisfy by construction, and the predicate is
mutation-tested (set `LYRA_READER_GPT3_GOLD` to a scratch copy of the TSV to try it);
corpus-wide labelled examples are still needed for the acceptance criteria. The arXiv revisions
and SHA-256 hashes are locked in `tests/eval/arxiv-lock.tsv`;
`python3 scripts/verify-eval-papers.py /path/to/corpus` checks existing files. Downloads verify
the lock before replacing files. PDFium defaults to `chromium/8100` with published archive
checksums; `--tag` explicitly opts into a different engine baseline.

To measure the native release app with continuous scripted input:

```bash
./scripts/build-rust.sh
(cd apps/macos && swift build -c release)
python3 scripts/measure-native-scroll.py eval-papers/2005.14165.pdf --runs 3 --zoom 100 --output build/scroll-100
python3 scripts/measure-native-scroll.py eval-papers/2005.14165.pdf --runs 3 --zoom 400 --output build/scroll-400
```

Each run opens a temporary PDF copy, starts at the top, uses a 48 MiB cache, warms for two
seconds, then calls the wheel handler's model scroll method for eight seconds at 600 screen points/s.
It never waits for raster completion between inputs. It bypasses `NSEvent` delivery and the
canvas wheel handler's immediate draw, exercising queued redraws. Raw logs and `results.json` retain every
run's peak RSS in bytes, MB and MiB, input/submission/presentation interval tails, queue depth,
platform, commit and PDF/engine/executable hashes. Missing, stationary or wholly occluded traces fail.
The window is brought forward for measurement. Partial occlusion is reported explicitly.
With tracing enabled, a diagnostic `CAMetalLayer` observes the same drawable wgpu acquires
and registers a Metal presentation handler. FPS uses the drawable's `presentedTime` host
timestamp, as documented by [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldrawable/presentedtime),
not the handler's arrival time or the CPU submission timestamp. A zero timestamp counts as a reported
drop only when other callbacks in the same trace carry a real host time. When no callback carries a
positive timestamp, `presentation_measurement` is `"unavailable"` with a `presentation_measurement_reason`
and `presented_fps`, the presentation gap tails, `presented_frames` and `motion_presented_frames` are all
`null`: the session reported no presentation time (a sleeping display or an occluded window), so the trace
never claims 0 fps and never claims `"complete"`. The raw evidence stays: `presentation_callbacks`,
`presentation_callbacks_missing`, `presentation_zero_timestamps` and `presentations_outside_window` are
counts.
Missing callbacks make FPS and presentation tails unavailable; they never count as
confirmed drops. Frames presented after the scrolling window are reported separately.
`presented_fps` counts frames over the full scrolling interval; frame gaps include both edges,
and `motion_presented_frames` separates frames whose scroll position changed. This records
system-reported drawable presentation, not physical scanout, display refresh rate or GPU
execution time. Scripted input is not a physical trackpad trace, and a finite run alone does
not certify the 60 fps criterion. Legacy logs remain readable but cannot supply presented FPS.
Peak RSS (`wait4`), CPU submission pacing (`submission_gap_*`, `input_gap_*`) and draw-CPU
timings (`draw_cpu_p95_ms`) are unaffected by presentation availability and stay real.
`--scheduling-diagnostics` additionally records frame-loop/model timing and adds logging overhead.

Keep memory units and the aggregation rule explicit: **400 MB = 381.47 MiB**. A 387.3 MiB
median is about 406.1 MB and does not meet a decimal 400 MB limit; a median below a limit also
does not prove that every run's peak is below it. The published debug-build measurements and
CLI raster timings alone do not establish the full M1 memory/60 fps acceptance criteria.

All-zero Metal presentation timestamps are reported as unavailable, with FPS and drop counts left
unset; they are not evidence of 0 FPS. The native scroll harness also accepts `--zoom 140` for the
ordinary-zoom page-cache path.

### Page cache and navigation measurements

After a release build, the native checks executable can measure CPU raster retention for any local PDF:

```bash
LYRA_READER_PDFIUM_PATH="$PWD/vendor/pdfium/lib/libpdfium.dylib" /usr/bin/time -l \
  apps/macos/.build/release/LyraReaderChecks --measure-page-rasters /path/to/paper.pdf 2.8 3
LYRA_READER_PDFIUM_PATH="$PWD/vendor/pdfium/lib/libpdfium.dylib" /usr/bin/time -l \
  apps/macos/.build/release/LyraReaderChecks --measure-page-navigation /path/to/paper.pdf 140
LYRA_READER_PDFIUM_PATH="$PWD/vendor/pdfium/lib/libpdfium.dylib" \
  apps/macos/.build/release/LyraReaderChecks --measure-page-fallback /path/to/paper.pdf 140
```

`2.8` represents 140% on a 2x display. The first command totals actual BGRA bytes across all pages
while retaining at most three; it reports raster median/p95 and `/usr/bin/time` reports process peak RSS.
The second uses a temporary document copy, a 959×715pt viewport at 2x, and measures model raster
readiness on cold, neighbor, return and distant jumps (PDFs longer than eight pages). It reports partial
sharp updates and immediate sharp cache hits. It excludes GPU upload and presentation, so it is not FPS
or end-to-end visual latency. `LYRA_READER_SHARP_PAGE_RASTERS=0` disables the screen-page path for a
feature-off comparison under the same pixel budget. Deep zoom remains on tiles.

What a cold page shows *before* its sharp raster is measured, not assumed. The third command records the
canvas-update quality timeline for cold, neighbor, return and distant jumps; on a real 115-page paper
(959×715pt viewport, 2x backing scale, 48 MiB budget, medians of five runs in one interleaved A/B) it
shows: at 100% the 264×342 sidebar thumbnail for 20.1 ms, then a sharp 1224×1584 raster at 20.8 ms; at
140% the same thumbnail for 28.3 ms, then 1714×2218 at 28.8 ms (the verification measured 39-51 ms on
its machine); at 400%, where the tiled path is used, the thumbnail for 7-14 ms, then a 1x 612×792
preview for 35-55 ms, then sharp tiles. A destination past the first 24 pages and outside the prepared
neighborhood has no thumbnail at all and shows nothing for 16-28 ms instead. Rendering a half-scale
raster first was measured and rejected: it halves the blurry window (28.3 → 13.7 ms at 140%, 20.1 →
11.1 ms at 100%) but adds a whole extra render before the sharp one (28.8 → 49.6 ms and 20.8 → 59.4 ms
to a sharp page), which is the property this path exists to protect.

## Milestones at a glance

| Milestone | Theme | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M0 | Skeleton, FFI path, GPU interop spike (a PDF page texture on screen) | ✅ Complete |
| M1 | Minimum readable loop | Core implemented; performance, memory/leak budgets and scheduling exit criteria remain unverified. PDFium lifecycle locking review: resolved in PR #6 |
| M2 | Reading experience | Core implemented; normal-open initialization, tab/cache isolation and stale search handling repaired. Named, reorderable user bookmarks (sidecar-persisted) and facing pages with a configurable page gap are implemented. Cross-page selection, incremental search, navigation history, split view and full session restoration remain. |
| M3 | Annotation and editing | Partial: durable sidecar highlights/underlines/strikeouts/notes with undo/redo, sticky markup tools, and PDF write-back (Save Annotated Copy / Save and Replace Original) for highlights, underlines, strikeouts and `/Text` notes with verified atomic writes, a byte-identical backup on replace, append-only saves and sidecar deduplication. Highlight/underline/strikeout appearance streams are not written because PDFium's C ABI cannot express the multiply blend (see the write-back section; PDFKit synthesizes the mark correctly). A sidecar that cannot be read still refuses every write, but the reader can back it up and start fresh from the alert (the original file is moved, never overwritten). Note edits coalesce their disk writes and flush on commit, document switch, tab close and quit. Annotations are exported as Markdown or CSV, labelled with their source and threaded by reply. Ink and shape annotations are drawn in a vector overlay, stored as versioned page-space sidecar entries and written back as `/Ink`, `/Square`, `/Circle` and `/Line` (with `/L`, `/LE`, `/BS` and a real `/AP` appearance stream); they can be selected by their stroke, moved and deleted, with undo/redo covering all three. Free text is written as a `/FreeText` annotation whose appearance uses a per-document subset of the bundled Noto Sans SC (renamed LyraReader Sans SC, SIL OFL 1.1) embedded as Type0/Identity-H with `FontFile2`, `CIDToGIDMap`, `/W` and `/ToUnicode`; Chinese, Japanese, Greek and maths characters render in the appearance, and a character outside the subset paints as `.notdef` while `/Contents` and extraction stay exact. Page operations (rotate, delete, reorder, insert blank, extract, merge and split, all through the verified write path) and AcroForm forms are implemented; the sidecar still lacks document-fingerprint validation and cross-process conflict detection. |
| M4 | Advanced reading | Partial: resizable, scrollable previews; complete resolved citation text with entry switching; Algorithm detection; full-page fallback for uncertain table/vector regions. A `Table` reference previews the grid its border lines form — 20 of the 40 table captions in the twelve sample papers, the rest falling back to the page. Captions and per-page citation spans are indexed for the whole document, not the first 120 pages, so a reference to a figure or a citation near the end of a 900-page book resolves like one on page 8. A grouped citation resolves to **every** work it names (`[1,11,19]` lists three entries), and bibliography entries are modelled as fragments (page and glyph range each), so a cross-page continuation is no longer a truncated rectangle. A document that prints more than one reference list (a main bibliography and an appendix's own, or a per-chapter thesis list) attributes each citation to the list its section cites — in the app's citation click as well as in the `cite` CLI, which prints the list and the reason, reports when a number exists only in an appendix list, and records an ambiguous choice instead of silently preferring the nearer list. On the **twenty-paper arXiv corpus**, 94.4% of 1826 detected citation spans resolve — the evaluation set is links only, no PDF is committed. Alphanumeric labels and groups (`[HR18]`, `[MCCD13, PSM14]`, `[VSP+ 17]`) now resolve: GPT-3 has 203 spans and 144 bibliography entries. Superscripts on papers that bracket their citations remain unsupported. Bare parenthesised numerals - (12), (3-5), (7, 9) - are detected when the document proves its bibliography is numeric and its body does not already bracket those citations, with equation numbers, function calls, years, enumerations, figure sub-labels and out-of-range labels rejected by position and context; a Science paper in the evaluation set went from no spans to twenty resolved ones while every other row stayed identical. A column gutter is now detected from the character runs inside each line (52 of the corpus's 298 pages, all in its seven two-column papers; the five single-column papers acquire none). Unlinked equations, vector-figure segmentation and index persistence remain. Preview pinning freezes the panel against document clicks; **Open in New Window** reopens the same page and region in a second independent reader window; a citation preview copies the document's generated BibTeX and is disabled when there is none. Document metadata (title, authors, venue, year, DOI, arXiv id) is recognised from XMP, `/Info` and page one, shown with per-field provenance in Document Information, editable, and exported as BibTeX with an offline generator. |
| M5 | AI assistant: summarization, translation, document chat, region-based discussion, RAG, local models | Partial: OpenAI-compatible streaming page/document summaries, selection Q&A and translation, local/remote visibility, request preview, Keychain, cancel/retry, usage and `[p.N]` page links. Document chat, vision/region discussion, summary merging and cross-platform credential stores remain. |
