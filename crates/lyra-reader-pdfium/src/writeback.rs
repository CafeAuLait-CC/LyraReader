//! Writing the reader's annotations into a PDF, under the safety contract.
//!
//! # Why this lives beside the PDFium backend
//!
//! The write itself is PDFium's: `FPDFPage_CreateAnnot` + `FPDFAnnot_Set*` + `FPDF_SaveAsCopy`
//! with [`FPDF_INCREMENTAL`](https://pdfium.googlesource.com/pdfium/). Everything else in this
//! module is the part that must not depend on PDFium being correct:
//!
//! 1. **A user choice, not a background write.** Nothing here runs unless the caller asks for
//!    [`SaveMode::Copy`] or [`SaveMode::ReplaceOriginal`]. There is no autosave.
//! 2. **Append-only — unless something was removed.** An ordinary save leaves every original
//!    byte at its original offset and verifies that the output's prefix *is* the source. When
//!    the request deletes annotations, an incremental update cannot free their objects, so the
//!    save finishes with a pruned full rewrite (`rewrite`): the removed dictionaries, their
//!    replies and popups, and every other unreachable byte are gone. That path verifies the
//!    rewritten document is equivalent to the source (pages, text, forms, outline, metadata,
//!    attachments) before the rename; a feature it cannot preserve refuses the save.
//! 3. **Atomic.** The bytes are written to a new temporary file in the destination's own
//!    directory, flushed, `fsync`ed, reopened and verified, and only then renamed over the
//!    target. A crash at any earlier point leaves the target untouched and at most one
//!    `<name>.lyra-reader-save-*.tmp` file behind, which
//!    [`cleanup_interrupted_save_temporaries`] removes on the next save and
//!    [`interrupted_save_note`] reports on the next open.
//! 4. **A backup before replacement.** [`SaveMode::ReplaceOriginal`] writes
//!    `<name>.lyra-reader-backup-<unix>-<n>.<ext>` first, verifies it byte-for-byte, and refuses to run
//!    if any part of that fails. Overwriting the original happens by rename after the backup is
//!    durable.
//! 5. **Verified.** Before the rename, the temporary file is reopened with
//!    [`AnnotationReader`] and every requested annotation is checked field by field. Every
//!    annotation the source already had is also read before and after and compared, so an
//!    incremental save that disturbes an existing annotation fails instead of replacing the
//!    original.
//!
//! # Appearance streams (honest limitation)
//!
//! PDFium's C API has exactly one way to attach an appearance stream to an annotation:
//! `FPDFAnnot_SetAP`. Its implementation creates the form XObject **and its `/ExtGState`**, and
//! that graphics state is hard-coded to `/BM /Normal` (PDFium `fpdf_annot.cpp`,
//! `SetExtGStateInResourceDict(doc, annot_dict, "Normal")`; measured against the vendored
//! dylib, whose output contains `/BM/Normal`). There is no public call that puts `/BM /Multiply`
//! in that state, and writing a `Normal` state for a translucent highlight would make Preview
//! tint the glyphs instead of multiplying into the page — strictly worse than no appearance at
//! all, because the two viewers would then disagree about the same file.
//!
//! This writer therefore does **not** write `/AP` for the quad-based kinds, which now includes
//! `/StrikeOut`: it has the same `/QuadPoints` and `/C` contract as an underline, just a
//! different line position. Both PDFium and PDFKit synthesize the appearance from those keys;
//! the macOS test suite renders a saved copy with PDFKit and asserts that the highlight covers
//! the line while the glyph pixels stay black, which is the multiply-like result Preview is
//! expected to show. A viewer that requires an explicit `/AP` (some older readers do) will show
//! nothing; the alternative was to
//! write a state that is knowingly wrong. See the task report and `README.md` for the measurement.
//!
//! Ink, shapes, sticky notes and free text are different: they have no blend mode to get wrong,
//! and PDFium's C API cannot write the keys they need (`/BS`, `/L`, `/Name`, `/DA`, `/Q`, or a
//! real `/AP` form XObject). They are written by [`crate::geometry_write`] (the direct lopdf
//! writer, named for the first kinds it handled): a stroked mark gets a real `/AP /N` **and** its
//! geometry, a sticky note gets `/Name /Comment`, and a text box gets `/DA`, `/Q` **and** an
//! appearance stream. The appearance objects are appended by the same save as the annotation
//! dictionaries and are verified before the rename. A viewer that ignores the appearance can
//! still synthesize the stroke or the free text; a viewer that ignores both shows nothing, which
//! no such viewer in this environment did.
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! Every PDFium call made here is delegated to [`AnnotationAppender`] /
//! [`AnnotationReader`], which serialise on `PDFIUM_LOCK`. The file-system half of this module
//! holds no lock.
