//! Editing and removing annotations a PDF **already carries**, through an incremental update.
//!
//! The append-only writer in [`crate::geometry_write`] can add objects; this module is the other
//! half: it rewrites the annotation dictionary the file already has, and removes annotations from
//! the page's `/Annots`. Both use lopdf's [`IncrementalDocument`], so every original byte stays
//! the output's prefix (the save contract in [`crate::writeback`] verifies that) and a file
//! somebody may have signed keeps its signature valid.
//!
//! # Why the annotation object is copied, not rebuilt
//!
//! A foreign annotation carries keys this reader does not model: `/Popup`, `/Parent`, `/IRT`,
//! `/Name`, `/Open`, `/IC`, `/DS`, producer-private keys. Rebuilding the dictionary from the
//! reader's model would drop them, and a reply whose `/IRT` disappeared is an orphan. This
//! module therefore clones the source dictionary and changes **only** the keys the editor owns
//! (`/C`, `/CA`, `/Contents`, `/M`, the geometry keys, `/DA`/`/Q` for free text, and `/AP` when
//! the appearance must change). `/NM`, `/T`, `/Subj`, `/F`, `/Popup`, `/Parent`, `/IRT` and every
//! unknown key are byte-for-byte what they were.
//!
//! # What is regenerated, and what is not
//!
//! | kind | appearance |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `/Highlight`, `/Underline`, `/StrikeOut`, `/Squiggly` | regenerated when colour or opacity changes, from the file's own `/Rect`, `/QuadPoints` and `/BM`; the new `/AP /N` states the same blend and constant alpha. A comment-only edit keeps the producer's `/AP` untouched. |
//! | `/Text` (sticky note) | untouched. The icon is the viewer's glyph, selected by `/Name`; moving `/Rect` keeps it. |
//! | `/FreeText` | regenerated: a form XObject with the exact new text, colour, size and alignment, in the bundled font. |
//! | `/Ink`, `/Square`, `/Circle`, `/Line` | regenerated when colour, opacity, geometry or border width changes; a comment-only edit keeps the producer's own appearance. |
//!
//! The quad geometry of a text mark is never rewritten: this reader can edit its comment and
//! colour but not the words it covers, so `/Rect` and `/QuadPoints` stay the file's own. An ink
//! stroke or a shape can be moved; its geometry is written back from the editor's page-space
//! model.
//!
//! # Deletion, popups and replies
//!
//! Deleting an annotation does two things in the same incremental revision:
//!
//! 1. removes its reference from every page's `/Annots`; and
//! 2. removes the annotations that depend on it — every `/IRT` reply, transitively, and its
//!    `/Popup` (the note window; an annotation with `/Parent` pointing at the deleted one).
//!
//! A reply is never left pointing at an object that is no longer in the annotation tree. The
//! popup is not a reply: it is the window of the deleted note, and keeping it would leave a
//! window with no note. The objects themselves stay in the file as unreferenced bytes, because
//! an incremental update cannot free an object; they are no longer part of the document's
//! annotation tree. A full rewrite (the redaction path) could drop those bytes, at the cost of
//! invalidating signatures — this reader deliberately does not do that here.
//!
//! # Identity
//!
//! Annotations are found by the same identity [`crate::annotations::AnnotationReader`] reports:
//! `nm:<NM>` when the file names the annotation, otherwise a stable fingerprint of its subtype,
//! `/Rect`, `/Contents`, `/T` and `/M`. An annotation that has no `/NM` gets one when it is first
//! edited (the shell supplies its cached annotation UUID as `assign_name`), so the identity the reader
//! shows after the save is stable too.
