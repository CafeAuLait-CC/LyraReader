//! Page operations on a **copy** of a PDF: rotate, delete, reorder, insert blank, extract.
//!
//! # Why this uses PDFium's C ABI directly
//!
//! `pdfium-render` covers rendering and page geometry, but the editing calls this feature needs
//! (`FPDFPage_SetRotation`, `FPDFPage_Delete`, `FPDF_MovePages`, `FPDFPage_New`,
//! `FPDF_ImportPagesByIndex`, `FPDF_SaveAsCopy`) are either not wrapped or wrapped without a
//! mutating document handle. The module therefore resolves the edit symbols from the same
//! dynamic library the backend already loads. Every call happens under
//! [`PDFIUM_LOCK`](crate::backend::PDFIUM_LOCK), exactly like the annotation reader/writer.
//!
//! # The safety model in one paragraph
//!
//! The source file is **read into memory** and never modified. The operation is applied to that
//! in-memory copy, saved into a temporary file, reopened and verified, and only then renamed into
//! the destination. A copy destination is never the source; replacing a destination writes a
//! byte-identical backup first. This is the same contract as
//! [`crate::writeback::save_annotated_pdf`], and the file-handling half is literally the same
//! code ([`writeback::write_rewritten_pdf`]).
//!
//! # Page maps
//!
//! Every report carries `page_map`: `page_map[old] = Some(new)` for a page that survived and
//! `None` for a page that was deleted (or not selected by an extraction). The shell uses it to
//! remap the reader's sidecar annotations and bookmarks. Embedded PDF annotations are handled by
//! PDFium: moving a page moves its annotation dictionary with it, deleting a page deletes its
//! annotations, and importing pages copies them. The tests assert that, because it is the kind
//! of behaviour a viewer must not assume from a page-tree edit.
//!
//! # Rotation
//!
//! Page rotation is `/Rotate`, not baked-in geometry. Rotating a page rotates its content and
//! its annotations at display time. [`PageOperation::SetRotation`] takes explicit values because
//! "reset to the file's original rotation" is a property of the file the session started from,
//! which this module cannot recover after earlier edits; the shell keeps the per-page original
//! values and passes them back.
//!
//! # What this module refuses
//!
//! * Deleting every page: a PDF must keep at least one.
//! * Page indices outside the document, duplicate indices, empty selections.
//! * Password-protected documents (PDFium's re-save of an encrypted document cannot be verified
//!   without the password and may drop encryption; refusing is safer than writing an output the
//!   caller cannot check).
//! * Any operation whose verified output does not have the expected page count, rotations and
//!   page sizes. The destination is then untouched (and a backup, if one was made, still exists).
//!
//! # Threading
//!
//! [`RawDocument`] owns one `FPDF_DOCUMENT` and takes the process-wide lock for each call. A
//! document handle is never used without the lock. Drop closes it under the lock as well.
