//! Helpers shared by this crate's unit tests.
//!
//! They exist to remove two kinds of state that tests must not share:
//!
//! * **The checkout the test binary was compiled in.** `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` is baked
//!   into the binary at compile time. This repository keeps one `target/` directory for several
//!   checkouts (disk budget), so cargo can run a test binary that was compiled in a checkout
//!   that has since been removed; the compiled-in path then points into a tree that no longer
//!   exists while the committed fixtures are present in the checkout currently running the
//!   tests. [`fixture`] therefore resolves a fixture at run time: the working directory and its
//!   ancestors first (cargo starts a test binary in the package root of the checkout it is
//!   running), then the compiled-in path, with an explicit `LYRA_READER_TEST_FIXTURES` override
//!   for unusual layouts.
//!
//! * **Temporary directories keyed only by pid and the clock.** A name built from
//!   `process::id()` plus `SystemTime::now()` is not a reservation: two tests can observe the
//!   same timestamp, and a pre-existing entry with that name can be a symlink or a file.
//!   [`ScratchDir`] reserves a brand-new directory with `create_dir` (which fails atomically if
//!   the name exists), retries with a process-wide sequence number on collision, and removes
//!   the directory when it is dropped — including when a test panics.
