//! Flattening a copy: paint annotation appearances and form-field values into page content.
//!
//! # What "flatten" means here
//!
//! A flattened copy is a **new PDF**. For every page it draws the current appearance of each
//! annotation into the page's content stream, then removes the annotation objects; it does the
//! same for every AcroForm widget and removes the `/AcroForm` entry. Nothing is rasterised: the
//! appearances are Form XObjects (or, for the quad-based markup kinds, drawing commands
//! synthesised from `/QuadPoints`), so text, vectors and the text layer stay text and vectors.
//!
//! This is an appearance export, not a security feature. Removing an annotation makes it
//! slightly less easy to delete by accident; it does **not** prevent a content editor from
//! changing the painted bytes, and only a digital signature can reveal that the file changed
//! after signing.
//!
//! # What is deliberately kept
//!
//! * `/Link` annotations: they are navigation, not editable content. Flattening a link would
//!   turn a clickable reference into dead pixels.
//! * `/Text` sticky notes: their body is never painted on the page, so flattening one would
//!   silently destroy the only copy of the text. They stay as annotations, and the report says
//!   how many were kept.
//! * Replies (`/IRT`) and an annotation that has replies: a comment thread is not recoverable
//!   once its dictionaries are gone. Keeping the thread is the honest choice; the report counts
//!   the annotations kept for this reason.
//! * Any field whose appearance cannot be baked faithfully (no `/AP`, a push button, an orphan
//!   widget, a kind this build does not understand). The field and its widgets stay, the
//!   AcroForm is kept for them, and the report names the field and the reason.
//! * Signature fields are removed rather than baked: a flattened copy is a derived copy, and
//!   the reader's existing policy strips signature material from every derived copy. The report
//!   counts them.
//!
//! A markup annotation's `/Contents` (a comment attached to a highlight, an ink stroke, …) is
//! metadata rather than page paint. It is not drawn and cannot survive the removal of the
//! annotation; the report counts those comments so the loss is never silent.
//!
//! # Fidelity
//!
//! An annotation's `/AP /N` stream is placed by the algorithm in PDF 32000-1 §12.5.5: the
//! appearance box (BBox transformed by Matrix) is scaled independently in x and y into `/Rect`
//! and translated into place. The form is then drawn with `Do`, so its own `/Resources` (fonts,
//! images, `/SMask`, blend groups) remain intact and its `/Matrix` applies as the viewer would
//! apply it. No appearance stream is copied or rewritten; the page resources gain one named
//! reference to the original object.
