//! Removing content from a PDF for real: glyphs, vector paths, images and form XObjects.
//!
//! Task mapping: T3.12 (redaction that actually removes content).
//!
//! # What "removal" covers
//!
//! A redaction area is a rectangle on one page. Applying redactions rewrites the page content
//! streams and then **drops every object the rewrite no longer references** (the file is written
//! as a complete new document, not as an incremental update):
//!
//! * **Glyphs** whose PDFium loose box intersects an area are removed from the text-showing
//!   operator itself (`Tj` and `TJ`, including `'` and `"`). A `TJ` spacing adjustment takes the
//!   place of each removed run, so the surviving glyphs on the same line keep their original
//!   positions. Text outside the area is untouched and remains extractable.
//! * **Vector paths** whose painted bounding box intersects an area lose their painting
//!   operator. The whole path is removed even when only part of it intersects (redaction is
//!   allowed to remove more than asked, never less), which is observable: pixels of a long rule
//!   outside the black mark disappear too.
//! * **Images and form XObjects** whose placed bounding box intersects an area are removed as
//!   whole objects.
//! * **Inline images and shadings** cannot be attributed to a rectangle with the parser this
//!   module owns. A page that contains one and is being redacted is **rasterised** instead: the
//!   page is painted at [`RASTER_DPI`] with the areas burned in black, and its content is
//!   replaced by that one image. That removes everything on the page, including its text layer.
//!   The same fallback is used when the text page cannot be mapped one-to-one onto the page's
//!   text-showing operators (text inside a form XObject is the common case), because a redaction
//!   that misses extractable text is worse than one that removes too much.
//! * Every area is finally painted with a black fill rectangle, so the result shows the mark.
//!
//! After the new document is written to its temporary file, [`redact_pdf`] reopens it and
//! proves four things before the atomic rename: the page count is unchanged, no extractable
//! character intersects any area, the characters outside every area are exactly the characters
//! that were outside it before (except on rasterised pages, where the whole text layer is gone by
//! design), and the centre of every area renders black.
//!
//! # Safety contract
//!
//! This is destructive and irreversible, so it shares the writer's contract:
//!
//! 1. [`RedactionMode::Copy`] never touches the source; its destination may not be the source.
//! 2. [`RedactionMode::ReplaceOriginal`] writes and verifies a byte-identical backup of the
//!    original **before** the replacement file is built. If the backup cannot be written, nothing
//!    is replaced. The replacement itself is an atomic rename of a verified temporary file.
//! 3. On any error the original is left as it was and the temporary file is removed.
//! 4. Encrypted documents are refused: a full rewrite of an encrypted document cannot be
//!    verified without re-encrypting it, and a silently decrypted output would be worse than a
//!    refusal.
//!
//! # Coordinates
//!
//! [`RedactionArea::rect`] is in PDF user space (origin at the page's bottom-left corner, the
//! space `/MediaBox` and `/CropBox` use). The FFI layer converts the shell's top-left view-space
//! rectangles to this space with the same [`PageGeometry::view_to_page`] transform the rest of the
//! engine uses, so a redaction saved at any zoom lands on the same page content.
