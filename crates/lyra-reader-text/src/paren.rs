//! Bare parenthesised numeric citations: `(12)`, `(3–5)`, `(7, 9)`, `(2; 11)`.
//!
//! A large part of the numeric literature cites without brackets: Nature and Science print a
//! raised numeral, but many IEEE, ACM and journal variants print `(12)` at body size on the
//! baseline. The bracket path in [`find_citations`](crate::find_citations) only accepts `[12]`,
//! and the author-year path requires words and a four-digit year, so those papers used to show no
//! clickable citation at all. This module is the third detector.
//!
//! # A parenthesised number is a citation only in a numeric bibliography
//!
//! The parentheses are ambiguous on their own: `(3)` is an equation number, `(b)` a figure
//! sub-label, `(2020)` a year, `(1)` an enumeration. What separates a citation is the document's
//! own bibliography. The style is read once per document by
//! [`CitationStyle::for_document`](crate::CitationStyle::for_document), and this detector runs
//! only when both of these are true:
//!
//! * **The bibliography is a numbered list.** Its entries carry integer labels the numeric
//!   parser recovered from `[12]` or `12.` at the start of an entry, and at least two entries
//!   (half the list) are labelled that way. An author-year list (`He, T. 2024.`, label
//!   `He 2024`) fails this test, so a parenthesised year in such a paper is never a citation.
//! * **The body does not bracket its numeric citations.** This is the same guard superscripts
//!   use, and the same measurement put it there: a paper that writes `[12]` uses parentheses for
//!   equation numbers, enumerations and figure sub-labels, not for citations. On the twelve
//!   sample papers and the seven review PDFs — every one of them a bracketing or author-year
//!   document — this guard is what keeps the detector at **zero new spans**.
//!
//! # The rule set, and why each non-citation form is rejected
//!
//! A candidate is a `(` … `)` span of at most [`MAX_INNER_CHARS`] characters whose inside parses
//! as a list of integers: a single number, a range (`3–5`, `3-5`), a comma or semicolon list
//! (`7, 9`, `2; 11`), or a mixture (`3–5, 9`). Every candidate is then put through the gates
//! below, in this order. [`inspect_parenthesised_citations`] returns every one of them — accepted
//! or rejected — with the reason, which is what the CLI prints.
//!
//! 1. **Document proof.** No numeric bibliography, or a bracketing body: rejected before any
//!    geometry is read.
//! 2. **Year-shaped.** A label in `1900..=2100` is a year (`(2020)`), not an entry label. The
//!    largest bibliography in the corpora has 382 entries, far below that range.
//! 3. **Inside the list.** Every expanded label must be positive, no larger than the number of
//!    entries, and one of the integer labels the bibliography actually prints. A number larger
//!    than the bibliography's entry count therefore cannot become a citation.
//! 4. **Not a figure/table/equation/section token.** The words immediately before the number
//!    are read; `Figure 3(4)`, `Table 2(3)`, `Equation (3)` and `Section 4(12)` are rejected as
//!    references to a numbered object, not to a work. (`Figure 3(b)` never even becomes a
//!    candidate: its inside is not a numeral.)
//! 5. **In prose, not in a formula.** The candidate must sit inside a line that has at least
//!    [`PROSE_MIN`] letters besides it; it must not touch the preceding token (`f(3)`), follow a
//!    formula operator (`x = (3)`), or be drawn in a mathematical face. A paragraph's last line
//!    can hold only its final word and the citation that closes the sentence (`Zero (29).` on
//!    page 14 of the Science paper); that line is admitted when the citation is followed by the
//!    clause's punctuation, the text before it is words without digits or operators, and the line
//!    above in the same column runs into it instead of ending a sentence.
//! 6. **Not at the line's left edge.** A candidate with no text before it on its line is an
//!    enumeration (`(1) First item`, `(2) Second item`), not a citation to entry 1 or 2. The
//!    exception is the citation that opens a line because the paragraph wrapped or the page
//!    broke (`(18, 23).` at the top of page 12 of the Science paper): it is followed by the
//!    clause's punctuation and the line carries [`PROSE_MIN`] letters or more. A list marker is
//!    followed by the item's first word, not by punctuation.
//! 7. **Not right-aligned at the margin.** A display equation's number is set apart at the right
//!    edge of a line that is mostly formula, so it either ends a line with too little prose or is
//!    separated from the preceding text by more than [`DETACHED_GAP_PT`]. A citation at the end
//!    of a prose line has ordinary word spacing before it and plenty of letters on the line.
//!
//! What survives is the shape the corpora show: `(12)` inside a sentence, in a paper whose
//! bibliography prints `12.` or `[12]`. The labels are the same integer strings the bracket path
//! produces, so [`resolve_reference`](crate::resolve_reference) and every caller of it — the
//! click, the preview, the CLI — need no change.
