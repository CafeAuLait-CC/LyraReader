//! Superscript numeric citations: the Science and Nature style.
//!
//! `winds5,6,23-26` and `r-process1-3,10` carry no brackets at all, so the bracket path in
//! [`find_citations`](crate::find_citations) never sees them. What identifies them is geometry:
//! the numerals are set **smaller than the text they follow and raised above its baseline**, and
//! the text layer keeps the per-character boxes that say so ([`RawCharBox`]).
//!
//! # The rule, and where its numbers come from
//!
//! Measured over the two papers that exposed this style (arXiv `1710.05463`, Nature, and
//! `1712.01815`, Science) from [`RawCharBox`] geometry, the true superscript citations in
//! `1710.05463` agree on:
//!
//! * **height** 0.52–0.79 of the median height of the glyphs on their line — the boxes are
//!   font-metric boxes, so a superscript run is the whole smaller face, not a tight glyph box;
//! * **rise** +0.40 to +0.68 of that same median height above the line's median box bottom
//!   (4.1–7.7 pt on a 13.3 pt body);
//! * **font** always a text face (`TimesNewRomanPSMT`, `NimbusRomNo9L-Regu`), never a math or
//!   symbol face.
//!
//! The thresholds below sit outside that range on the permissive side, because a run's fate is
//! decided by corroboration, not by geometry: `SIZE_RATIO = 0.85` and `RAISE_RATIO = 0.30` also
//! admit mathematics, units and footnote markers — see the guards below.
//!
//! `1712.01815` contributes a negative result worth recording: its arXiv text layer renders the
//! citations as ordinary `(9)` / `(2, 14)` at body size on the baseline (height ratio 0.97, rise
//! +0.27 pt), so no geometric rule can see them there. The shape it does have is the short
//! parenthesised numeral, which is a body-size detector of its own: see
//! [`inspect_parenthesised_citations`](crate::inspect_parenthesised_citations), which reads it when the bibliography is a numbered list.
//!
//! # Why geometry alone is not enough
//!
//! The same geometry occurs in `x2`, `10-3`, `m2`, `cm2 g-1`, equation exponents and
//! author-affiliation markers, and in a numbered paper their numerals are *also* labels the
//! bibliography carries. Four guards therefore decide, in order of how much they cost:
//!
//! 1. **A numbered bibliography must exist.** A superscript numeral cites a numbered list; an
//!    author-year paper (labels are surnames and years) has nothing to corroborate against, so
//!    [`CitationStyle::for_document`] turns the whole detector off for it.
//! 2. **The body must not bracket its numeric citations.** `[12]` and a raised numeral are
//!    alternative ways to cite the same list, and the paper that brackets is the paper full of
//!    footnote markers and unit exponents. Measured: this one bit is the difference between 0
//!    and 69 spurious spans over the two corpora — 54 across the twenty evaluation papers and
//!    15 across the twelve regression samples, every one of them a footnote marker or an author
//!    affiliation (see the `reference_eval` module docs and this module's tests).
//! 3. **Every label of the run must exist in that list's label set.** A year, `cm3` and any
//!    paper whose list the parser read only in part are rejected here; `cm2` is not, which is
//!    why the next guard exists.
//! 4. **The run must read as an attachment to a word**: at least three letters touching it on
//!    the left within half a line height, and on the right whitespace, terminal punctuation or
//!    the end of the line. That is what rejects `x2` and `m2` (a symbol, not a word), `R2/c`,
//!    `1013Hz`, `1/2M¤`, and the affiliation number that opens a line.
//!
//! What survives all four is a citation except for one measured class: a superscript numeral
//! attached to a capitalised name in an author block (`Daniel Kasen1,2`) is geometrically and
//! bibliographically indistinguishable from a citation. The corpus measurement prints every run
//! this module accepts, so that class stays visible instead of being assumed away.
