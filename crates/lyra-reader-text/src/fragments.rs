//! Cutting a reference entry into the pieces it is really drawn in.
//!
//! # Why an entry is not one rectangle
//!
//! A bibliography entry is a run of glyphs, and the reader previews it by boxing those glyphs.
//! Two layouts make a single box wrong:
//!
//! * **A column break.** An entry that starts at the foot of the left column and continues at
//!   the head of the right one occupies two disjoint areas. The smallest rectangle containing
//!   both spans the whole gutter, so a preview drawn from it shows the neighbouring column as
//!   well — and on a page whose two columns hold different entries, that is the wrong text.
//! * **A page break.** The entry's last lines sit at the head of the next page. A box on the
//!   first page cannot show them at all.
//!
//! So an entry carries [`EntryFragment`]s: one page, one contiguous glyph range on that page,
//! and the box those glyphs occupy. The common case — one entry, one column, one page — is a
//! single fragment whose range and box are exactly what `start..end` described before.
//!
//! # How the pieces are found
//!
//! Nothing here invents geometry. The page's lines come from [`lines_from`], the entry's
//! paragraphs from [`blocks_from`], and the column boundary from
//! [`column_gutter`](crate::tables::column_gutter) — the same gutter test the table finder uses
//! to refuse a region that spans two columns. Every line is placed on one side of that gutter
//! (by construction no line crosses it, or `column_gutter` would not have reported it), and the
//! entry's glyphs are cut where that placement changes. A page that shows no gutter keeps its
//! entries as single fragments, exactly as before.
//!
//! Fragment ranges are a contiguous cover of the entry's own range, so each fragment can be
//! highlighted on its own: a fragment never names characters that belong to another fragment.
//!
//! # What it does to `text`
//!
//! When an entry continues on the following page, that page's opening lines are appended to
//! [`ReferenceEntry::text`] as well, so the entry's words and its fragments describe the same
//! content. The run that *selects* the bibliography has already been scored by then, so no
//! selection depends on text this pass adds.
//!
//! # What is measured
//!
//! `cargo test -p lyra-reader-cli --test entry_fragments_corpus -- --ignored --nocapture`,
//! on the twelve sample papers (2026-10-14): **769 entries, 790 fragments, 21 of them
//! multi-fragment — no column split at all, 21 page continuations — and 18 fragment boxes
//! crossing a gutter.**
//!
//! The 18 are the model's fallback, not a cut gone wrong. When one of an entry's paragraphs
//! crosses the boundary there is no tick between the columns to cut at — the paragraph is in both
//! columns at once — so [`PageGeometry::split`] refuses the cut for that entry and returns the
//! union of the entry's own glyphs, which is the box `page`/`start`/`end` described before
//! fragments existed. Those boxes are unchanged from the version of this code that detected no
//! gutters at all (checked by diffing the corpus report against `master`): what changed on
//! 2026-10-14 is that the detector reads 52 of the corpus' 298 pages as two-column, so the
//! comparison can now be made. The one geometry that did move is a single extra page
//! continuation, `Leader`'s entry 47 — the page's own line spacing and the stricter
//! same-column test admit it.
//!
//! On 2026-10-15 the crossing count is **13**, and the fallback explains it. T4.29 trims the
//! list's last entry where the page printed a section after it; five of the entries that used to
//! cross were carrying a page number that is set inside the gutter (`Pan` 35, `Leader` 53, `Yin`
//! 47, `Zhang` 90, `HumanML3D` 47), so their boxes no longer straddle the boundary — the
//! glyph that put them there is gone. The other thirteen are the fallback described above,
//! unchanged.
//!
//! Of the 21 page continuations, 17 are the entry's own words and 4 are page furniture the
//! geometric guard cannot tell from prose (`Dvorožňák 2017`, whose second fragment is a running
//! head and a figure caption, and `SMooDi` twice and `Leader` once, running heads). The guard does
//! throw away the two `manuscript_0925` cases (margin line numbers and the running head) and one
//! in `Leader` (a running head sharing the next label's line), which is why it is there.
//!
//! The layout that needs no damaged text layer to exercise the column rule is
//! `an_entry_split_across_two_columns_becomes_two_fragments` below and, through PDFium,
//! `entry_fragments_fixture.rs` in the CLI crate, which reads a generated two-column page.
