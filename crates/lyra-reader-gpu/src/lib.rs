//! GPU abstraction layer: wgpu context, surface management, tile compositing.
//!
//! **This is the only engine crate allowed to contain platform/GPU details** (see `docs/adr/0001`).
//!
//! # Threading model (hard rules, `docs/02-architecture.md` §3)
//!
//! - `wgpu::Device/Queue/Surface` and all textures are created/destroyed **only on the GPU submit thread**;
//! - The UI thread only submits [`CompositorCommand`]s;
//! - [`SurfaceTarget`] contains raw pointers and **does not implement `Send`**: it can only be turned into
//!   [`SurfaceId`] on the thread that created it, after which it is always referenced across threads by `SurfaceId`.
//!
//! # Device ownership (M0 T0.4 spike result)
//!
//! `docs/adr/0003` listed three strategies; the spike settled on the simplest one:
//!
//! | Option | Result |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | **B. Both sides use the process-wide default device** ✅ chosen | wgpu's Metal backend and AppKit's `CAMetalLayer` both take the device returned by `MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()`, so they are the *same* `MTLDevice` and textures interoperate. No private API, no hand-off call. |
//! | A. Rust owns the device and hands `MTLDevice` to Swift | Not reachable: `Device::as_hal` is gated behind wgpu's internal `cfg(wgpu_core)` (verified by reading wgpu 30.0.1's source). |
//! | C. Offscreen + IOSurface fallback | Kept as a documented fallback; not needed. |
