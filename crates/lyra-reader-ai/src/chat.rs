//! Platform-independent chat planning: settings validation, context selection, retrieval and
//! prompt assembly.
//!
//! The shell owns the window, the API key and the Keychain. This module owns what would be sent:
//! which page text, which retrieved blocks, which prompt, and the exact JSON body for each
//! request. A plan is built *before* any request starts, so the panel can show it and the reader
//! can decide whether to send it.
//!
//! Nothing here performs I/O, reads a key, or logs. A plan carries a transport-neutral request
//! description: the text parts, the page labels and the capture bytes. It never carries an
//! encoded image or a transport-specific JSON body; [`ChatPlan::render_body`] builds exactly one
//! body for the selected transport, and the preview and the send share that same string.
