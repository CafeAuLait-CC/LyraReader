//! Platform-independent chat planning: settings validation, context selection, retrieval and
//! prompt assembly.
//!
//! The shell owns the window, the API key and the Keychain. This module owns what would be sent:
//! which page text, which retrieved blocks, which prompt, and the exact JSON body for each
//! request. A plan is built *before* any request starts, so the panel can show it and the reader
//! can decide whether to send it.
//!
//! Nothing here performs I/O, reads a key, or logs. That keeps the plan cheap to test and makes
//! the privacy rule enforceable: the request preview and the request itself come from the same
//! [`ChatPart::wire_body`].
