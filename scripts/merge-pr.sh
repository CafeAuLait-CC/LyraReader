# Merge one or more pull requests, verify the result, and only then delete the
# branches. Written after two incidents where a branch was deleted although the
# merge call had failed, closing the pull request and losing its head ref. The
# rule this script enforces: a branch is deleted only for a pull request whose
# merge response said merged=true AND whose merged tree passed verification.
#
# Usage: scripts/merge-pr.sh <pr-number> [<pr-number> ...]
#        scripts/merge-pr.sh --skip-verify <pr-number> ...   (docs-only merges)
#
# Exits non-zero on the first problem and deletes nothing in that case.
